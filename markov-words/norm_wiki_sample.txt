 albert of prussia 17 may 1490 20 march 1568 was the last grand master of the teutonic knights who after converting to lutheranism became the first monarch of the duchy of prussia the secularized state that emerged from the former monastic state of the teutonic knights albert was the first european ruler to establish protestantism as the official state religion of his lands he proved instrumental in the political spread of protestantism in its early stage ruling the prussian lands for nearly six decades 15101568 a member of the brandenburg ansbach branch of the house of hohenzollern albert s election as grand master had brought about hopes of a reversal of the declining fortune of the teutonic knights he was a skilled political administrator and leader and did indeed reverse the decline of the teutonic order however albert who was sympathetic to the demands of martin luther rebelled against the catholic church and the holy roman empire by converting the teutonic state into a protestant and hereditary realm the his uncle the king of poland the arrangement was confirmed by the treaty of krakw in 1525 albert pledged a personal oath to the king and in return was invested with the duchy for himself and his heirs albert s rule in prussia was fairly prosperous although he had some trouble with the peasantry the confiscation of the lands and treasures of the catholic church enabled him to propitiate the nobles and provide for the expenses of the newly established prussian court he was active in imperial politics joining the league of torgau in 1526 and acted in unison with the protestants in plotting to overthrow emperor charles v after the issue of the augsburg interim in may 1548 albert established schools in every town and founded knigsberg university in 1544 he promoted culture and arts patronising the works of erasmus reinhold and caspar hennenberger albert s final years were clouded by peasant resentment of heavy taxes a step he felt compelled to take due to there no longer being any church land available to confiscate in and paul skali also caused various religious and political disputes albert spent his final years virtually deprived of power and died at tapiau on 20 march 1568 his son albert frederick succeeded him as duke of prussia albert s dissolution of the teutonic state caused the founding of the duchy of prussia paving the way for the rise of the house of hohenzollern he is therefore often seen as the father of the prussian nation and even as indirectly responsible for the unification of germany early life albert was born in ansbach in franconia as the third son of frederick i margrave of brandenburg ansbach his mother was sophia daughter of casimir iv jagiellon grand duke of lithuania and king of poland and his wife elisabeth of austria he was raised for a career in the church and spent some time at the court of hermann iv of hesse elector of cologne who appointed him canon of the cologne cathedral despite being quite religious he was also interested in mathematics and teachings of the church in favour of scientific theories his career was forwarded by the church however and institutions of the catholic clerics supported his early advance turning to a more active life albert accompanied emperor maximilian i to italy in 1508 and after his return spent some time in the kingdom of hungary grand master duke frederick of saxony grand master of the teutonic order died in december 1510 albert was chosen as his successor early in 1511 in the hope that his relationship to his maternal uncle sigismund i the old grand duke of lithuania and king of poland would facilitate a settlement of the disputes over eastern prussia which had been held by the order under polish suzerainty since the second peace of thorn 1466 the new grand master aware of his duties to the empire and to the papacy refused to submit to the crown of poland as war over the order s existence appeared inevitable albert made strenuous efforts to secure allies and carried on by the ravages of members of the order in poland culminated in a war which began in december 1519 and devastated prussia albert was granted a four year truce early in 1521 the dispute was referred to emperor charles v and other princes but as no settlement was reached albert continued his efforts to obtain help in view of a renewal of the war for this purpose he visited the diet of nuremberg in 1522 where he made the acquaintance of the reformer andreas osiander by whose influence albert was won over to protestantism the grand master then journeyed to wittenberg where he was advised by martin luther to abandon the rules of his order to marry and to convert prussia into a hereditary duchy for himself this proposal which was understandably appealing to albert had already been discussed by some of his relatives but it was necessary to proceed cautiously and he assured pope adrian vi that he was anxious to reform the order and punish the knights who had adopted lutheran doctrines luther but in order to facilitate the change made special efforts to spread his teaching among the prussians while albert s brother margrave george of brandenburg ansbach laid the scheme before their uncle sigismund i the old of poland duke in prussia after some delay sigismund assented to the offer with the provision that prussia should be treated as a polish fiefdom and after this arrangement had been confirmed by a treaty concluded at krakw albert pledged a personal oath to sigismund i and was invested with the duchy for himself and his heirs on 10 february 1525 the estates of the land then met at knigsberg kaliningrad and took the oath of allegiance to the new duke who used his full powers to promote the doctrines of luther this transition did not however take place without protest summoned before the imperial court of justice albert refused to appear and was proscribed while the order elected a new grand master walter von cronberg who received prussia as a fief at the experiencing the tumult of the reformation the german peasants war and the wars against the ottoman turks they did not enforce the ban on the duke and agitation against him soon died away in imperial politics albert was fairly active joining the league of torgau in 1526 he acted in unison with the protestants and was among the princes who banded and plotted together to overthrow charles v after the issue of the augsburg interim in may 1548 for various reasons however poverty and personal inclination among others he did not take a prominent part in the military operations of this period the early years of albert s rule in prussia were fairly prosperous although he had some trouble with the peasantry the lands and treasures of the church enabled him to propitiate the nobles and for a time to provide for the expenses of the court he did something for the furtherance of learning by establishing schools in every town and by freeing serfs who adopted a scholastic life in 1544 where he appointed his friend andreas osiander to a professorship in 1549 albert also paid for the printing of the astronomical prutenic tables compiled by erasmus reinhold and the first maps of prussia by caspar hennenberger this step was the beginning of the troubles which clouded the closing years of albert s reign osiander s divergence from luther s doctrine of justification by faith involved him in a violent quarrel with philip melanchthon who had adherents in knigsberg and these theological disputes soon created an uproar in the town the duke strenuously supported osiander and the area of the quarrel soon broadened there were no longer church lands available with which to conciliate the nobles the burden of taxation was heavy and albert s rule became unpopular after osiander s death in 1552 albert favoured a preacher named johann funck who with an adventurer named paul skali exercised great influence over him and obtained considerable wealth at public expense the state of turmoil caused by these religious and political disputes was increased by the should that happen to appoint a regent as his only son albert frederick was still a mere youth the duke was forced to consent to a condemnation of the teaching of osiander and the climax came in 1566 when the estates appealed to king sigismund ii augustus of poland albert s cousin who sent a commission to knigsberg skali saved his life by flight but funck was executed the question of the regency was settled and a form of lutheranism was adopted and declared binding on all teachers and preachers virtually deprived of power the duke lived for two more years and died at tapiau on 20 march 1568 cornelis floris de vriendt designed his tomb within knigsberg cathedral albert was a voluminous letter writer and corresponded with many of the leading personages of the time legacy although albert has received relatively little recognition in german history his dissolution of the teutonic state caused the founding of the duchy of prussia which would eventually become arguably the most powerful albert is therefore often seen as the father of the prussian nation and even as indirectly responsible for the unification of germany he was a skilled political administrator and leader and effectively reversed the decline of the teutonic order until he betrayed it by transforming the order s lands into his own duchy secularizing it in the process albert was the first german noble to support luther s ideas and in 1544 founded the university of knigsberg the albertina as a rival to the roman catholic cracow academy it was the second lutheran university in the german states after the university of marburg a relief of albert over the renaissance era portal of knigsberg castle s southern wing was created by andreas hess in 1551 according to plans by christoph rmer another relief by an unknown artist was included in the wall of the albertina s original campus this depiction which showed the duke with his sword over his shoulder was the popular albertus the symbol of the university the original was moved to while the sculptor paul kimritz created a duplicate for the wall another version of the albertus by lothar sauer was included at the entrance of the knigsberg state and royal library in 1880 friedrich reusch created a sandstone bust of albert at the regierungsgebude the administrative building for regierungsbezirk knigsberg on 19 may 1891 reusch premiered a famous statue of albert at knigsberg castle with the inscription albert of brandenburg last grand master first duke in prussia albert wolff also designed an equestrian statue of albert located at the new campus of the albertina king s gate contains a statue of albert albert was oft honored in the quarter maraunenhof in northern knigsberg its main street was named herzog albrecht allee in 1906 its town square knig ottokar platz was renamed herzog

genetically modified maize corn is a genetically modified crop specific maize strains have been genetically engineered to express agriculturally desirable traits including resistance to pests and to herbicides maize strains with both traits are now in use in multiple countries gm maize has also caused controversy with respect to possible health effects impact on other insects and impact on other plants via gene flow one strain called starlink was approved only for animal feed in the us but was found in food leading to a series of recalls starting in 2000 marketed products herbicide resistant

liberty link corn that is resistant to glufosinate pioneer hi bred has developed and markets corn hybrids with tolerance to imidazoline herbicides under the trademark clearfield though in these hybrids the herbicide tolerance trait was bred using tissue culture selection and the chemical mutagen framework governing the approval of transgenic crops does not apply for clearfield as of 2011 herbicide resistant gm corn was grown in 14 countries by 2012 26 varieties herbicide resistant gm maize were authorised for import into the european union in 2012 the eu was reported to import 30 million tons a year of gm crops but such imports remain controversial cultivation of herbicide resistant corn in the eu provides substantial farm level benefits insecticide producing corn bt corn is a variant of maize that has been genetically altered to express one or more proteins from the bacillus thuringiensis bacteria the protein is poisonous to certain insect pests and is widely used in organic gardening the european corn borer causes about a billion dollars in damage to corn crops each year in recent years traits have been added to ward off corn ear worms and root worms the latter of which annually causes about a billion dollars in damages the bt protein is expressed throughout the plant when a vulnerable insect eats the bt containing plant the protein is human gut is acidic in the alkaline environment the protein partially unfolds and is cut by other proteins forming a toxin that paralyzes the insect s digestive system and forms holes in the gut wall the insect stops eating within a few hours and eventually starves in 1996 the first gm maize producing a bt cry protein was approved which killed the european corn borer and related species subsequent bt genes were introduced that killed corn rootworm larvae bt genes that are approved include the following singly and stacked event name between brackets cry1a 105 mon89034 cryiab mon810 cryif 1507 cry2ab mon89034

african researchers announced the production of transgenic maize resistant to maize streak virus msv although it has not been released as a product refuges us environmental protection agency epa regulations require farmers who plant bt corn to plant non bt corn nearby called a refuge to provide a location to harbor vulnerable pests the theory behind these refuges is to slow the evolution of resistance to the pesticide epa regulations also require seed companies to train farmers how to maintain refuges to collect data on the refuges and to report that data to the epa a study of these reports found that from 2003 to 2005 farmer compliance with keeping refuges was above corn farmers did not keep refuges properly raising concerns that resistance would develop unmodified crops received most of the economic benefits of bt corn in the us in 1996 2007 because of the overall reduction of pest populations this reduction came because females laid eggs on modified and unmodified strains alike resistance resistant strains of the european corn borer have developed in areas with defective or absent refuge management in november 2009 monsanto scientists found the pink bollworm had become resistant to first generation bt cotton in parts of gujarat india that generation expresses one bt gene cry1ac this was the first instance of bt resistance confirmed by monsanto anywhere in the world bollworm resistance to first generation bt cotton has been identified in the australia china spain and the united states in 2012 a florida field trial demonstrated that army worms were resistant to pesticide containing gm corn produced by dupont dow armyworm resistance was first discovered in puerto rico in 2006 prompting dow and dupont to voluntarily stop selling of gm crops varies between countries with some of the most marked differences occurring between the usa and europe regulation varies in a given country depending on intended uses controversy broad scientific consensus holds that food derived from gm crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food the scientific rigor of the studies regarding human health has been disputed due to alleged lack of independence and due to conflicts of interest involving governing bodies and some of those who perform and evaluate the studies gm crops provide a number of ecological benefits but there are also concerns for their overuse stalled research outside of the bt seed industry proper management and issues with bt resistance arising from their misuse critics have objected to gm crops on ecological economic and health grounds the economic issues derive from those organisms that are subject to intellectual property law mostly patents the first generation of gm crops lose patent protection beginning in 2015 monsanto has claimed it will not to pursue farmers who retain seeds of off patent plant to impact nontarget organisms before approving commercial release a 1999 study found that in a lab environment pollen from bt maize dusted onto milkweed could harm the monarch butterfly several groups later studied the phenomenon in both the field and the laboratory resulting in a risk assessment that concluded that any risk posed by the corn to butterfly populations under real world conditions was negligible a 2002 review of the scientific literature concluded that the commercial large scale cultivation of current btmaize hybrids did not pose a significant risk to the monarch population a 2007 review found that nontarget invertebrates are generally more abundant in bt cotton and bt maize fields than in nontransgenic fields managed with insecticides however in comparison with insecticide free control fields certain nontarget taxa are less abundant in bt fields gene flow gene flow is the transfer of genes and or alleles from one species to another concerns focus on the interaction between gm and other maize varieties in mexico and of gene flow into refuges in 2009 the government of mexico created a is the center of diversity for maize gene flow could affect a large fraction of the world s maize strains a 2001 report in nature presented evidence that bt maize was cross breeding with unmodified maize in mexico the data in this paper was later described as originating from an artifact nature later stated the evidence available is not sufficient to justify the publication of the original paper a 2005 large scale study failed to find any evidence of contamination in oaxaca however other authors also found evidence of cross breeding between natural maize and transgenic maize a 2004 study found bt protein in kernels of refuge corn food the french high council of biotechnologies scientific committee reviewed the 2009 vendmois et al study and concluded that it presents no admissible scientific element likely to ascribe any haematological hepatic or renal toxicity to the three re analysed gmos a 2011 canadian study looked at the presence of cryab1 protein

of the incident which was later bought by bayer fifty one people reported adverse effects to the fda us centers for disease control cdc which determined that 28 of them were possibly related to starlink however the cdc studied the blood of these 28 individuals and concluded there was no evidence of hypersensitivity to the starlink bt protein a subsequent review of these tests by the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act scientific advisory panel points out that while the negative results decrease the probability that the cry9c protein is the cause of allergic symptoms in the individuals examined in the absence of a positive control and questions regarding the sensitivity and specificity of the assay it is not possible to assign a negative predictive value to this of the starlink bt proteins since 2001 in 2005 aid sent by the un and the us to central american nations also contained some starlink corn the nations involved nicaragua honduras el salvador and guatemala

kurgan had been ritually bound before burial and the custom of binding the dead persists for example in rural anatolia nineteenth century anthropologist james frazer stated in his classic work the golden bough that souls were seen as the creature within that animated the body ghosts and the afterlife although the human soul was sometimes symbolically or literally depicted in ancient cultures as a bird or other animal it appears to have been widely body in every feature even down to clothing the person wore this is depicted in artwork from various ancient cultures including such works as the egyptian book of the dead which shows deceased people in the afterlife appearing much as they did before death including the style of dress fear of ghosts while deceased ancestors are universally regarded as venerable and often imagined as having a continued presence in some sort of afterlife the spirit of a deceased person which remains present in the material world viz a ghost is regarded as an unnatural or undesirable state of affairs and the idea of ghosts or revenants is associated with a reaction of fear this is universally the case in pre modern folk cultures but fear of ghosts also remains an integral aspect of the modern ghost story gothic horror and other horror fiction dealing with the supernatural common attributes another widespread belief concerning ghosts is that they are composed of a misty airy or subtle material the person within the person the person s spirit most noticeable in ancient cultures as a person s breath which upon exhaling in colder climates appears visibly as a white mist this belief may have also fostered the metaphorical meaning of breath in certain languages such as the latin spiritus and the greek pneuma which by analogy became extended to mean the soul in the bible god is depicted as synthesising adam as a living soul from the dust of the earth and the breath of god in many traditional accounts ghosts were often thought to be deceased

reported is described as haunted and often seen as being inhabited by spirits of deceased who may have been former residents or were familiar with the property supernatural activity inside homes is said to be mainly associated with violent or tragic events in the building s past such as murder accidental death or suicide sometimes in the recent or ancient past but not all hauntings are at a place of a violent death or even on violent grounds many cultures and religions believe the essence of a being exist some religious views argue that the spirits of those who have died have not passed over and are trapped inside the property where their memories and energy are strong history ancient near east and egypt 33 8401 401 8436 there are many references to ghosts in mesopotamian religions the religions of sumer babylon assyria and other early states in mesopotamia traces of these beliefs survive in the later abrahamic religions that came to dominate the region the 5th century bc play oresteia contains one of the first ghosts to appear in a work of fiction roman empire and late antiquity the ancient romans believed a ghost could be used to exact revenge on an enemy by scratching a curse on a piece of lead or pottery and placing it into a grave plutarch in the 1st century ad described the haunting of the baths at chaeronea by the ghost of a murdered man the ghosts loud and frightful groans caused the people of the town to seal up a haunted house from the ancient classical world is given by pliny the younger c 50 ad pliny describes the haunting of a house in athens by a ghost bound in chains the hauntings ceased when the ghost s shackled skeleton was unearthed and given a proper reburial the writers plautus and lucian also wrote stories about haunted houses in the new testament jesus has to persuade the disciples that he is not a ghost following the resurrection luke 24 3739 some versions of the bible such as the kjv and nkjv use the term spirit in a similar vein jesus followers at first believe him to be a ghost spirit when they see him walking on water one of the first persons to express disbelief in ghosts was lucian of samosata in the 2nd century ad in his tale the doubter circa 150 ad he relates how democritus the learned man from abdera in thrace lived in a tomb outside the city gates to prove that cemeteries were not how he persisted in his disbelief despite practical jokes perpetrated by some young men of abdera who dressed up in black robes with skull masks to frighten him this account by lucian notes something about the popular classical expectation of how a ghost should look in the 5th century ad the christian priest constantius of lyon recorded an instance of the recurring theme of the improperly buried dead who come back to haunt the living and who can only cease their haunting when their bones have been discovered and properly reburied middle ages ghosts reported in medieval europe tended to fall into two categories the souls of the dead or demons the souls of the dead returned for a specific purpose demonic ghosts were those which existed only to torment or tempt the living the living could tell them apart by demanding their purpose in the name of jesus christ the soul of a dead person would divulge their mission while a demonic ghost would be banished at the sound of the holy name most ghosts were to atone for their transgressions in life their penance was generally related to their sin for example the ghost of a man who had been abusive to his servants was condemned to tear off and swallow bits of his own tongue the ghost of another man who had neglected to leave his cloak to the poor was condemned to wear the cloak now heavy as a church tower these ghosts appeared to the living to ask for prayers to end their suffering other dead souls returned to urge the living to confess their sins before their own deaths medieval european ghosts were more substantial than ghosts described in the victorian age and there are accounts of ghosts being wrestled with and physically restrained until a priest could arrive to hear its confession some were less solid and could move through walls often they were described as paler and sadder versions of the person they had been while alive and dressed in tattered gray rags the vast majority of reported sightings were male there were night in the forest or in the remains of an iron age hillfort as at wandlebury near cambridge england living knights were sometimes challenged to single combat by phantom knights which vanished when defeated from the medieval period an apparition of a ghost is recorded from 1211 at the time of the albigensian crusade gervase of tilbury marshal of arles wrote that the image of guilhem a boy recently murdered in the forest appeared in his cousin s home in beaucaire near avignon this series of visits lasted all of the summer through his cousin who spoke for him the boy allegedly held conversations with anyone who wished until the local priest requested to speak to the boy directly leading to an extended disquisition on theology the boy narrated the trauma of death and the unhappiness of his fellow souls in purgatory and reported that god was most pleased with the ongoing crusade against the cathar heretics launched three years earlier the time of the albigensian crusade this constant bloodshed and dislocation of populations being the context for these reported visits by the murdered boy haunted houses are featured in the 9th century arabian nights such as the tale of ali the cairene and the haunted house in baghdad european renaissance to romanticism renaissance magic took a revived interest in the occult including necromancy in the era of the reformation and counter reformation there was frequently a backlash against unwholesome interest in the dark arts typified by writers such as thomas erastus the swiss reformed pastor ludwig lavater supplied one of the most frequently reprinted books of the period with his of ghosts and spirits walking by night the child ballad sweet william s ghost 1868 recounts the story of a ghost returning to his fiance begging her to free him from his promise to marry her he can not marry her because he is dead but her refusal would mean his damnation this reflects a popular british belief that a new love without some formal release the unquiet grave expresses a belief even more widespread found in various locations over europe ghosts can stem from the excessive grief of the living whose mourning interferes with the dead s peaceful rest in many folktales from around the world the hero arranges for the burial of a dead man soon after he gains a companion who aids him and in the end the hero s companion reveals that he is in fact the dead man instances of this include the italian fairy tale fair brow and the swedish the bird grip modern period of western culture spiritualist movement editorial note 379 8839 spiritualism is a monotheistic belief system or religion postulating a belief in god but with a distinguishing feature of belief that spirits of the dead residing in the spirit world can be contacted by mediums who can then provide information about the afterlife by 1897 it was said to have more than eight million followers the middle and upper classes while the corresponding movement in continental europe and latin america is known as spiritism the religion flourished for a half century without canonical texts or formal organization attaining cohesion by periodicals tours by trance lecturers camp meetings and the missionary activities of accomplished mediums many prominent spiritualists were women most followers supported causes such as the abolition of slavery and women s suffrage by the late 1880s credibility of the informal movement weakened due to accusations of fraud among mediums and formal spiritualist organizations began to appear spiritualism is currently practiced primarily through various denominational spiritualist churches in the united states and united kingdom spiritism editorial note 376 9220 spiritism or french spiritualism is based on the five books of the spiritist codification written by french educator hypolite lon denizard rivail under the pseudonym allan kardec reporting sances in which he observed a series of phenomena that he attributed to incorporeal intelligence spirits his assumption of spirit communication was validated by many contemporaries and studied the phenomena his work was later extended by writers like leon denis arthur conan doyle camille flammarion ernesto bozzano chico xavier divaldo pereira franco waldo vieira johannes greber and others spiritism has adherents in many countries throughout the world including spain united states canada japan germany france england argentina portugal and especially brazil which has the largest proportion and greatest number of followers scientific view the physician john ferriar wrote an essay towards a theory of apparitions in 1813 in which he argued that sightings of ghosts were the result of optical illusions later the french physician alexandre jacques franois brire de boismont published on hallucinations or the rational history of apparitions dreams ecstasy magnetism and somnambulism in 1845 in which he claimed sightings of ghosts were the result of hallucinations david turner a retired physical chemist suggested that ball lightning could cause inanimate objects to move erratically that there was no credible scientific evidence that any location was inhabited by spirits of the dead according to research in anomalistic psychology visions of ghosts may arise from hypnagogic hallucinations waking dreams which are experienced in the transitional states to and from sleep in a study of two experiments into alleged hauntings wiseman et al 2003 came to the conclusion that people consistently report unusual experiences in haunted areas because of environmental factors which may differ across locations some of these factors included the variance of local magnetic fields size of location and lighting level stimuli of which witnesses may not be consciously aware some researchers such as michael persinger of laurentian university canada have speculated that changes in geomagnetic fields created e g by tectonic stresses in the earth s crust or solar activity could stimulate the brain s temporal lobes and produce many of the experiences associated with hauntings sound is thought to be another cause of supposed sightings richard lord and richard wiseman have in a room such as anxiety extreme sorrow a feeling of being watched or even the chills carbon monoxide poisoning which can cause changes in perception of the visual and auditory systems was speculated upon as a possible explanation for haunted houses as early as 1921 by religion judo christian the hebrew torah and the bible contain a few references to ghosts associating spiritism with forbidden occult activities the most notable reference is in the first book of samuel in which a disguised king saul has the witch of endor summon the spirit ghost of samuel in the new testament jesus has to persuade the disciples that he is not a ghost following the resurrection luke 24 3739 some versions of the bible such as the kjv and nkjv use the term spirit similarly jesus followers at

people and draw them away from god and into bondage as a result attempts to contact the dead may lead to unwanted contact with a demon or an unclean spirit as was said to occur in the case of robbie mannheim a fourteen year old maryland youth the seventh day adventist view is that a soul is not equivalent to spirit or ghost depending on the bible version and that save for the holy spirit all spirits ghosts are demons in disguise furthermore they teach that in accordance with genesis 2 7 ecclesiastes 12 7 there are only two components to a soul neither of which survives death with each returning to its respective source christadelphians reject the view of a living conscious soul after death the talmud tells of a being called a shade that is similar to other creatures in that it lives and dies but consists only of a form but lacks matter that forms mass thus rendering it invisible since it has no end of the world to the other islam according to islamic teachings there are no

european folklore belief in ghosts in european folklore is characterized by the recurring fear of returning or revenant deceased who may harm the living this includes the scandinavian gjenganger the romanian strigoi the serbian vrykolakas etc in scandinavian and finnish tradition ghosts appear in corporeal form and their supernatural nature is given away by behavior rather than appearance in fact in many stories they are first mistaken for the living they may be mute appear and disappear suddenly or leave no footprints or other traces british folklore is particularly notable for its numerous haunted locations belief in the soul and an afterlife remained near universal until the emergence of atheism in the 18th century in the 19th century spiritism resurrected belief in ghosts as the

steep increase about 32 percent of americans believe in ghosts depiction in the arts ghosts are prominent in the popular cultures of various nations the ghost story is ubiquitous across all cultures from oral folktales to works of literature renaissance to romanticism 1500 to 1840 one of the more recognizable ghosts in english literature is the shade of hamlet s murdered father in shakespeares the tragical history of hamlet prince of denmark in hamlet it is the ghost who demands that prince hamlet investigate his murder most foul and seek revenge upon his usurping uncle king claudius in shakespeares macbeth the murdered banquo returns as a ghost to the dismay of the title character in english renaissance theater ghosts were often depicted in the garb of the living and even in armor as with the ghost of hamlets father armor being out of date by the time of the renaissance gave the stage ghost a sense of antiquity but the sheeted century because an armored ghost could not satisfactorily convey the requisite spookiness it clanked and creaked and had to be moved about by complicated pulley systems or elevators these clanking ghosts being hoisted about the stage became objects of ridicule as they became clichd stage elements ann jones and peter stallybrass in renaissance clothing and the materials of memory point out in fact it is as laughter increasingly threatens the ghost that he starts to be staged not in armor but in some form of spirit drapery an interesting observation by jones and stallybrass is that ghosts figured prominently in traditional british ballads of the 16th and 17th centuries particularly the border ballads of the turbulent border country between england and scotland ballads of this type include the unquiet grave the wife of usher s well and sweet william s ghost which feature the recurring theme of returning dead lovers or children in the ballad king kings horse and hounds before forcing the king into bed the king then awakens to find the ghost transformed into a beautiful woman one of the key early appearances by ghosts in a gothic tale was the castle of otranto by horace walpole in 1764 washington irving s short story the

stories were influenced by the gothic fiction tradition and contain elements of folklore and psychology m r james summed up the essential elements of a ghost story as malevolence and terror the glare of evil faces the stony and long drawn distant screams are all in place and so is a modicum of blood shed with deliberation and carefully husbanded famous literary apparitions from this period are the ghosts of a christmas carol in which ebenezer scrooge is helped to see the error of his ways by the ghost of his former colleague jacob marley and the ghosts of christmas past christmas present and christmas yet to come oscar wilde s comedy the canterville ghost has been adapted for film and television on several occasions henry james s the turn of the screw has also appeared in a number of

this was replaced by the euro on 1 january 2014 etymology the name latvija is derived from the name of the ancient latgalians one of four indo european baltic tribes along with couronians selonians and semigallians which formed the ethnic core of modern latvians together with the finnic livonians history around 3000 bce the proto baltic ancestors of the latvian people settled on the eastern coast of the baltic sea the balts established trade routes to rome and byzantium trading local amber for precious metals by 900 ce four selonians semigallians in latvian kuri latgai si and zemgai as well as the livonians lbiei speaking a finnic language the medieval period although the local people had contact with the outside world for centuries they were more fully integrated into european society in the 12th century the first missionaries sent by the pope sailed up the daugava river in the late 12th century seeking converts the local people however did not convert to christianity as readily as hoped german crusaders were sent into latvia to convert the population from their original pagan beliefs by force of arms in the beginning of the 13th century large parts of today s latvia were ruled by germans together with southern estonia these conquered areas formed the crusader state that became known as terra mariana or livonia in 1282 riga and later the cities of csis hanseatic league and formed close cultural contacts with western europe the reformation period the 16th 17th and 18th centuries were a time of great change for the inhabitants of latvia including the reformation the collapse of the livonian state and the time when the latvian territory was divided up among foreign powers after the livonian war 15581583 livonia latvia fell under polish and lithuanian rule the southern part of estonia and the northern part of latvia were ceded to the grand duchy of lithuania and formed into the ducatus ultradunensis prdaugavas hercogiste gotthard kettler the last master of the order of livonia formed the duchy of courland and semigallia though the duchy was a vassal state to poland it retained a considerable degree of autonomy and experienced a golden age in the 17th century latgalia the easternmost region of latvia became a part of the polish district of inflanty the 17th and early 18th centuries saw a struggle between the the eastern baltic after the polishswedish war 16001611 northern livonia including vidzeme came under swedish rule riga became the capital of swedish livonia and the largest city in the entire swedish empire fighting continued sporadically between sweden and poland until the truce of altmark in 1629 in latvia the swedish period is generally remembered as positive serfdom was eased a network of schools was established for the peasantry and the power of the regional barons was diminished several important cultural changes occurred during this time under swedish and largely german rule western latvia adopted lutheranism as its main religion the ancient tribes of the couronians semigallians selonians livs and northern latgallians assimilated to form the latvian people speaking one latvian language throughout all the centuries however no such thing as a latvian state existed so the borders and definitions of who exactly fell within that group are largely subjective meanwhile largely isolated from the rest of latvia southern latgallians adopted catholicism under polish jesuit influence many polish and russian loanwords latvia in the russian empire 17101917 the capitulation of estonia and livonia in 1710 and the treaty of nystad ending the great northern war in 1721 gave vidzeme to russia it became part of the governorate of livonia during the great northern war 17001721 up to 40 per

peter the great s wife marta later catherine i of russia was the only the serfs took place in courland in 1817 and in vidzeme in 1819 in practice however the emancipation was actually advantageous to the landowners and nobility as it dispossessed peasants of their land without compensation forcing them to return to work at the estates of their own free will during the 19th century the social structure changed dramatically a class of independent farmers established itself after reforms allowed the peasants to repurchase their land but many landless peasants remained there also developed a growing urban proletariat and an increasingly influential latvian bourgeoisie the young latvian movement laid the groundwork for nationalism from the middle of the century many of its leaders looking to the slavophiles for support against the prevailing german dominated social order the rise in use of the latvian language in literature and society became known as the first national awakening russification began in latgale after the polish led the january uprising in 1863 this spread to the rest of what is now latvia by the 1880s the young latvians were largely and political movement in the 1890s popular discontent exploded in the 1905 russian revolution which took a nationalist character in the baltic provinces during these two centuries latvia experienced economic and construction boom ports were expanded riga became the largest port in the russian empire railways built new factories banks and university were established many residential public theatres and museums and school buildings erected new parks formed etc riga s boulevards and streets with beautiful buildings outside the old town date from this period declaration of independence world war i devastated the territory of what would become the state of latvia including other western parts of the russian empire demands for self determination were at first confined to autonomy but the russian 1917 revolution treaty with germany at brest litovsk and allied armistice with germany on 11 november 1918 created a power vacuum the people s council of latvia proclaimed the independence of the new country in riga on 18 november 1918 with krlis ulmanis becoming independence that followed was part of a general chaotic period of civil and new border wars in eastern europe by the spring of 1919 there were actually three governmentsulmanis s government the latvian soviet government led by pteris stuka whose forces supported by the red army occupied almost all of the country and the baltic german government of the united baltic duchy headed by andrievs niedra and supported by the baltische landeswehr and the german freikorps unit iron division estonian and latvian forces a freely elected constituent assembly convened on 1 may 1920 and adopted a liberal constitution the satversme in february 1922 the constitution was partly suspended by krlis ulmanis after his coup in 1934 but reaffirmed in 1990 since then it has been amended and is still in effect in latvia today with most of latvia s industrial base evacuated to the interior of russia in 1915 radical land reform was the central political question for the young state in 1897 61 2 that percentage had been reduced to 18 by 1923 the extent of cultivated land surpassed the pre war level innovation and rising productivity led to rapid growth of the economy but it soon suffered from the effects of the great depression latvia showed signs of economic recovery and the electorate had steadily moved toward the centre during the parliamentary period on 15 may 1934 ulmanis staged a bloodless coup establishing a nationalist dictatorship that lasted until 1940 after 1934 ulmanis established government corporations to buy up private firms with the aim of latvianising the economy latvia in world war ii early in the morning of 24 august 1939 the soviet union and nazi germany signed a 10 year non aggression pact called the molotovribbentrop pact the pact contained a secret protocol revealed only after germany s defeat in 1945 according to which the states of northern and eastern europe were divided into german and soviet spheres of influence in the north latvia finland and estonia were assigned to the soviet sphere respective portions of poland after the conclusion of the molotov ribbentrop pact most of the baltic germans left latvia by agreement between ulmanis government and nazi germany under the heim ins reich programme in total 50 000 baltic germans left by the deadline of december 1939 with 1 600 remaining to conclude business and 13 000 choosing to remain in latvia most of those who remained left for germany in summer 1940 when a second resettlement on 5 october 1939 latvia was forced to accept a mutual assistance pact with the soviet union granting the soviets the right to station between 25 000 and 30 000 troops on latvian territory after staging border incidents on 16 june 1940 the government of the ussr handed the latvian ambassador in moscow a note in which latvia was accused of breaching the articles of the agreement of 5 october 1939 and demands were made for sending in additional soviet troops and to change the government the latvian government capitulated in the face of overwhelming force on 17 june soviet troops invaded latvian territory in soviet forces are marching into our land this very morning this is happening with the knowledge and consent of the government which in turn stems from the amicable relations that exist between latvia and the soviet union it is therefore my wish that the residents of our country also show friendship towards the advancing military units the government has resigned i shall remain in my place you remain in yours no opposition was shown towards the soviet forces on the contrary part of the population accepted the news of their arrival with enthusiasm which was heavily exploited by soviet propaganda the well known russian lawyer and public figure of latvia pyotr yakobi wrote taken from the german model the authoritarian beginning in our country has turned into a government of national bureaucracy having satisfied a limited circle of citizens who have adapted themselves to the state pie clearly any hardship is not in vain and so now the down trodden have raised their voice and demand a return those unhappy with the regime of krlis ulmanis included people who were anxious about the deteriorating economic situation and had no desire to end up under nazi german rule state administrators were liquidated and replaced by soviet cadres in which 34 250 latvians were deported or killed elections were held with single pro soviet candidates listed for many positions the resulting people s assembly immediately requested admission into the ussr which the soviet union granted latvia then a puppet government was headed by augusts kirhenteins the soviet union incorporated latvia on 5 august 1940 as the latvian soviet socialist republic the soviets dealt harshly with their opponents prior to the german invasion in less than a year at least 27 586 people were arrested most were deported for cooperating with the german army and about 945 were shot under german occupation latvia was administered as part of reichskommissariat ostland latvian paramilitary and auxiliary police units established by the occupation authority participated in the holocaust as well more including approximately 75 000 latvian jews murdered during the nazi occupation latvian soldiers fought on both sides of the conflict including in the latvian legion of the waffen ss most of them conscripted by the occupying nazi and soviet authorities soviet era 19401941 19441991 in 1944 when soviet military advances reached the area heavy fighting took place in latvia between german and soviet troops which ended in another german defeat in the course of the war both occupying forces conscripted latvians into their armies in this way increasing the loss of the nation s live resources in 1944 part of the latvian territory once more came under soviet control the soviets immediately began to reinstate the soviet system after the german surrender it became clear that soviet forces were there to stay and latvian national partisans soon joined by german collaborators began to fight against the new occupier anywhere from 120 000 to as many as 300 000 latvians took refuge from the soviet army by fleeing to germany and sweden with perhaps as many as 80 000 to 100 000 of them recaptured by the soviets or during few months immediately after the end of war returned by the west the soviets reoccupied the country in 19441945 and further deportations followed as the country was collectivised and sovieticised on 25 march 1949 43 000 rural residents kulaks and latvian patriots nationalists were deported to siberia in a sweeping operation priboi in all three baltic states which was carefully planned and approved in moscow already on 29 january 1949 an extensive programme to impose bilingualism was initiated in latvia limiting the use of latvian language in official uses in favour of using

publishing house in riga and establishing a committee of national salvation to usurp governmental functions during the transitional period moscow maintained many central soviet state authorities in latvia in spite of this 73 of all latvian residents confirmed their strong support for independence on 3 march 1991 in a nonbinding advisory referendum the popular front of latvia advocated that all permanent residents be eligible for latvian citizenship however universal citizenship for all permanent residents was not adopted a majority of ethnic non latvians did not receive latvian citizenship

nanomaterials to nanoelectronic biosensors and even possible future applications of molecular nanotechnology current problems for nanomedicine involve understanding the issues related to toxicity and environmental impact of nanoscale materials materials whose structure is on the scale of nanometers i e billionths of a meter nanomedicine research is receiving funding from the us national institutes of health of note is the funding in 2005 of a five year plan to set up four nanomedicine centers in april 2006 the journal nature materials estimated that 130 nanotech based drugs and delivery systems were being developed worldwide overview the biological and medical research communities have exploited the unique properties of nanomaterials for various applications e g contrast agents for cell imaging and therapeutics for treating cancer terms such as biomedical nanotechnology nanobiotechnology and nanomedicine are used to describe this hybrid field functionalities can be added to nanomaterials by of nanomaterials is similar to that of most biological molecules and structures therefore nanomaterials can be useful for both in vivo and in vitro biomedical research and applications thus far the integration of nanomaterials with biology has led to the development of diagnostic devices contrast agents analytical tools physical therapy applications and drug delivery vehicles nanomedicine seeks to deliver a valuable set of research tools and clinically useful devices in the near future the national nanotechnology initiative expects new commercial applications in the pharmaceutical industry that may include advanced drug delivery systems new therapies and in vivo imaging neuro electronic interfaces and other nanoelectronics based sensors are another active goal of research further down the line the speculative field of molecular nanotechnology believes that cell repair machines could revolutionize medicine and the medical field nanomedicine is a large industry with nanomedicine sales reaching 6 8 billion in 2004 and with over 200 companies and 38 products worldwide a minimum of 3 8 billion in nanotechnology r amp d is being invested every year as the nanomedicine industry significant impact on the economy medical use of nanomaterials two forms of nanomedicine that have already been tested in mice and are awaiting human trials that will be using gold nanoshells to help diagnose and treat cancer and using liposomes as vaccine adjuvants and as vehicles for drug transport similarly drug detoxification is also another application for nanomedicine which has shown promising results in rats a benefit of using nanoscale for medical technologies is that smaller devices are less invasive and can possibly be implanted inside the body plus biochemical reaction times are much shorter these devices are faster and more sensitive than typical drug delivery advances in lipid nanotechnology was also instrumental in engineering medical nanodevices and novel drug delivery systems as well as in developing sensing applications drug delivery nanotechnology has provided the possibility of delivering drugs to specific cells using nanoparticles the overall drug consumption and side effects may be lowered significantly by depositing the active agent in the morbid region only and in no higher dose than needed this highly selective approach would found in dendrimers and nanoporous materials another example is to use block co polymers which form micelles for drug encapsulation they could hold small drug molecules transporting them to the desired location another vision is based on small electromechanical systems nanoelectromechanical systems are being investigated for the active release of drugs some potentially important applications include cancer treatment with iron nanoparticles or gold shells targeted drug delivery is intended to reduce the side effects of drugs with concomitant decreases in consumption and treatment expenses the increased efficiency of delivery results in overall societal benefit by reducing the amount of drug needed in an equipotent preparation of said therapy and thus reduced cost to the consumer nanomedical approaches to drug delivery center on developing nanoscale particles or molecules to improve drug bioavailability bioavailability refers to the presence of drug molecules where they are needed in the body and where they will do the most good drug delivery focuses on maximizing bioavailability both at specific places in the body and over a period of time this can potentially be achieved by targeting the molecules and delivering drugs with cell precision more than 65 billion are wasted each year due to poor bioavailability in vivo imaging is another area where tools and devices are being developed using nanoparticle contrast agents images such as ultrasound and mri have a favorable distribution and improved contrast the new methods of nanoengineered materials that are being developed might be effective in treating illnesses and diseases such as cancer what nanoscientists will be able to achieve in the future is beyond current imagination this might be accomplished by self assembled biocompatible nanodevices that will detect evaluate treat and report to the clinical doctor automatically drug delivery systems lipid or polymer based nanoparticles can be designed to improve the pharmacological and therapeutic properties of drugs the strength of drug delivery systems is their ability to alter the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of the drug however the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nanomedicine is highly variable among different patients when designed to avoid the body s defence mechanisms nanoparticles have beneficial properties larger particles would have been cleared from the body cells take up these nanoparticles because of their size complex drug delivery mechanisms are being developed including the ability to get drugs through cell membranes and into cell cytoplasm efficiency is important because many diseases depend upon processes within the cell and can only be impeded by drugs that make their way into the cell triggered response is one way for drug molecules to be used more efficiently drugs are placed in the body and only activate on encountering a particular signal for example a drug with poor solubility will be replaced by a drug delivery system where both hydrophilic and hydrophobic environments exist improving the solubility also a drug may cause tissue damage but with drug delivery regulated drug release can eliminate the problem if a drug is cleared too quickly from the body this could force a patient to use high doses but with drug delivery systems clearance can be reduced by altering the pharmacokinetics of the drug poor biodistribution is a problem the particulates from drug delivery systems lower the volume of distribution and reduce the effect on non target tissue potential nanodrugs will work by very specific and well understood mechanisms one of the major impacts of nanotechnology and nanoscience will be in leading development of completely new drugs with more useful behavior and less side effects polymeric nano particles are a competing technology to lipidic based mainly on phospholipids nano particles there is an additional risk of toxicity associated with polymers not widely studied or understood this toxicity could include but not limited to hepatotoxicity nephrotoxicity etc and can have long term impacts not easily evaluated in short term in vivo clinical trials either in animals or humans since the degradation of polymers to either their monomers or other degradation products in the body can not be accurately predicted unclear metabolic pathway this is a real risk specially in medicines intended for long term patient use even if the toxicity is ignored there is additional hepatic load of metabolism again an area of concern for long term medication cost and predictable characterisation so the formulation chemists prefer this however in the patient s body this very stability slow degradation is a negative factor phospholipids on the other hand are membrane lipids already present in the body and surrounding each cell have a gras generally recognised as safe status from fda and are derived from natural sources without any complex chemistry involved they are not metabolised but rather absorbed by the body and the degradation products are themselves nutrients fats or micronutrients it is greatly observed that nanoparticles are promising tools for the advancement of drug delivery medical imaging and as diagnostic sensors however the biodistribution of these nanoparticles is still imperfect due to the complex host s reactions to nano and microsized materials sup 14 sup and the difficulty in targeting specific organs in the body nevertheless a lot of work is still ongoing to optimize and better understand the potential and limitations of nanoparticulate systems for example current research in the excretory systems of mice organs based on their size and charge these composites are encapsulated by a dendrimer and assigned a specific charge and size positively charged gold nanoparticles were found to enter the kidneys while negatively charged gold nanoparticles remained in the liver and spleen it is suggested that the positive surface charge of the nanoparticle decreases the rate of opsonization of nanoparticles in the liver thus affecting the excretory pathway even at a relatively small size of 5 nm though these particles can become compartmentalized in the peripheral tissues and will therefore accumulate in the body over time while advancement of research proves that targeting and distribution can be augmented by nanoparticles the dangers of nanotoxicity become an important next step in further understanding of their medical uses nanoparticles are also used to circumvent multidrug resistance mdr mechanisms mechanisms of mdr include decreased uptake of drugs reduced intracellular drug concentration by activation of the efflux transporters modifications in cellular pathways by altering cell cycle checkpoints increased metabolism of drugs induced emergency response genes to impair apoptotic pathways research studies abraxane approved by the u s food and drug administration fda to treat breast cancer non small cell lung cancer nsclc and pancreatic cancer is the nanoparticle albumin bound paclitaxel doxil was originally approved by the fda for the use on hiv related kaposi s sarcoma it is now being used to also treat ovarian cancer and multiple myeloma the drug is encased in liposomes which helps to extend the life of the drug that is being distributed liposomes are self assembling spherical closed colloidal structures that are composed of lipid bilayers that surround an aqueous space the liposomes also help to increase the functionality and it helps to decrease the damage that the drug does to the heart muscles specifically in a mice study scientists from rice university and university of texas md anderson cancer center reported enhanced effectiveness and reduced toxicity of an existing treatment for head and neck cancer when using the nanoparticles to deliver the drug the hydrophilic carbonic clusters functionalized with polyethylene glycol or peg hcc are mixed with the chemotherapeutic receptor egfr targeted cetuximab and injected intravenously they found the tumors were killed more effectively with radiation and the healthy tissue suffered less toxicity than without the nanotechnology drug delivery the standard treatment contains cremophor el which allows the hydrophobic paclitaxel to be delivered intravenously replacing the toxic cremophor with carbon nanoparticles eliminated its side effect and improved drug targeting which in turn required a lower dose of the toxic paclitaxel researchers at case western reserve university reported using nanoparticle chain to deliver doxorubicin to breast cancer cells in a mice study three magnetic iron oxide nanospheres were chemically linked to one doxorubicin loaded liposome and formed a 100 nm long nanoparticle chain after the nanochains penetrated the tumor radiofrequency field was generated that caused the magnetic nanoparticles to vibrate and rupture the liposome dispersing the drug in its free form throughout the tumor the result showed that the nano treatment was more effective in halting tumor growth than the standard treatment with doxorubicin it is also less harmful to healthy cells since only 5 to 10 of the standard dose peg carrying payload of antibiotics at its core could swift charge thus allowing them to target bacterial infection more precisely inside the body a group of mit researchers reported the nanoparticles containing a sub layer of ph sensitive chains of the amino acid histidine carry a slightly negative charge when circulating in the blood stream can evade detection and clearing by the immune system when they encounter an infection site the particles gain a positive charge provoked by the slightly acidic environment at the infection sites allowing them to bind to the negatively charged bacterial cell walls and release antibiotics at locally high concentration this nano delivery system can potentially destroy bacteria even if it has developed resistance to antibiotics because of the targeted high dose and prolonged release of the drug although a lot of work is still needed the researchers believe that it points to a new direction of using nanotechnology to treat infectious disease using the biomimetic strategy researchers in the harvard university wyss institute demonstrated in a mouse model that the drug coated nanoparticles regions in the blood vessels just like the platelets do aggregates of biodegradable nanoparticles coated with tissue plasminogen activator tpa each about the size of a platelet were injected intravenously in the region of vessel narrowing shear stresses dissociate the aggregates and release the tpa coated nanoparticles which bind and degrade the blood clots by prcised targeting and concentrating drug at the location of obstruction the dose used is less than 1 50th of the normal dose the nanotherapeutics will greatly reduce the severe side effect of bleeding commonly found in standard treatment of thrombosis an early phase clinical trial using the platform of minicell nanoparticle for drug delivery have been tested on patients with advanced and untreatable cancer built from the membranes of mutant bacteria the minicells were loaded with paclitaxel and coated with cetuximab antibodies that bind the epidermal growth factor receptor egfr which is often overexpressed in a number of cancers as a homing device to the tumor cells the tumor cells recognize the bacteria from which the minicells engulf it once inside the payload of anti cancer drug kills the tumor cells measured at 400 nanometers the minicell is bigger than synthetic particles developed for drug delivery the researchers indicated that this larger size gives the minicells a better profile in side effects because the minicells will preferentially leak out of the porous blood vessels around the tumor cells and do not reach the liver digestive system and skin this phase 1 clinical trial demonstrated that this treatment is well tolerated by the patients as a platform technology the minicell drug delivery system can be used to treat a number of different cancers with different anti cancer drugs with the benefit of lower dose and less side effects researchers at the methodist hospital research institute in houston have created leukolike vectors or llvs llvs are the drug carrying silicon nanoparticles coated with the lipoprotein removed from the membranes of the white blood cells leukocytes the cloaked nanoparticles were found to behave like leukocytes are able to evade the body s immune system and survive much longer the scientists expressed that llvs are able to overcome a major hurdle in nanomedicine delivery by avoiding clearance in blood stream crossing the biological barriers and localizing at target tissues due to its leukocyte like characters synthetic membranes are expected to develop in the future to replace harvest from the white blood cells due to the limited source of leukocyte inhalable nanocarriers were developed using a nanostructured lipid nanocarrier based system nlcs the lipid nanoparticles contain the drug payload doxorubicin or paclitaxel two types of small interfering rna sirna targeted the bcl 2 mrna to suppress nonpump cellular resistance and mrp1 mrna to suppress pump drug resistance and the targeting molecules an analog of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone lhrh which homes in the overexpressed receptors of the cancer cells the disease model tested was a mouse model of human lung cancer results showed enhanced antitumor activity and significant reduction of exposure of healthy organs when compared to the conventional intravenous treatment self powered nanoparticles with a payload of osteoporosis drug are reported to be pulled ion gradients generated by leaked minerals ions from the bone and deliver highly targeted drugs for healing using a model system of human tibia and femur researchers from pennsylvania state university and boston university used nanoparticles of polylactic coglycolic acid widely used in medical devices carrying sodium alendronate an osteoporosis drug for the in vitro experiments and found the nanotrucks successfully carry the drug to the fresh crack of the human bone nanodiamond is diamond particle with a diameter of 2 to 8 nm and surface functional groups to bind various kinds of molecule clusters of the nanodiamonds in the range of 50 100 nm in diameter can be manufactured to trap drug inside and slowly release the payload experiments by researchers in northwestern university on mouse models with chemotherapy resistant liver and breast cancers show that the nanodiamonds with a normally lethal dose of doxorubicin significantly reduce the size of the tumors without toxic side effects expected from the drug if administered alone the nanodiamond drug complex is found to have a much longer and once inside the tumor the nanoparticles are retained much longer additional studies using nanodiamonds include treating the triple negative breast cancer with epirubicin and glioblastoma with doxorubicin increase in survival rate with reduced side effects were observed in both the mouse models ucla reported that contact lens embedded with nanodiamonds at the size of 5 nm in diameter and loaded with the glaucoma drug timolol maleate allow controlled and sustained release of the medicine the nanodiamonds were combined with the polymer chitosan which is cleaved when the lens make contact with the lysozyme in tears the drug releases slowly in the eyes when the nanodiamond structure breaks down in regenerative medicine research silica based nanoparticles are used to deliver molecules to transplanted cells derived from stem cells using a mouse model scientists delivered two synthetic versions of neurotrophic growth factors locally using mesoporous nanoparticles to motor neurons derived from transplanted embryonic stem cells and reported improved long term survival and functional differentiation of the transplant in vivo nanoparticle with a liposomal core and a gel to shrink breast cancer tumor in a mouse model researchers in the north carolina state university designed this nanoparticle called gelipo to deliver both drugs simultaneously and maximize the efficiency of both the cross linked hyaluronic acid ha shell holds and protects the tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand trail while the core carries liposomes filled with doxorubicin embedded with peptide ha preferentially concentrates in hyaluronidase haase rich tumor environment and interacts with receptors on the cancer cell membranes when the haase degrades the gel shell of gelipo the trail protein is released onto the cell membrane and triggers apoptosis cell death the core liposomes are internalized by the tumor cells into endosomes the cellular transport system the peptide breaks down the endosome and releases doxorubicin intracellularly maximizes the efficacy while minimizes the toxic side effects protein and peptide delivery protein and peptides exert multiple biological actions in the human body and they have been identified as showing great promise for treatment of various diseases and disorders these macromolecules are using nanomaterials like nanoparticles and dendrimers is an emerging field called nanobiopharmaceutics and these products are called nanobiopharmaceuticals applications and reported research studies nanoparticles delivering the myelin antigens were found to induce immune tolerance in a mouse model with relapsing multiple sclerosis biodegradable polystyrene microparticles coated with the myelin sheath peptides reset the mouse s immune system and prevent the disease from recurring or reduce the symptoms by halting the attack of the immune system to the protective myelin sheath coating the nerve fibers of the central nervous system team of researchers in northwestern university indicated that this treatment method can potentially be used in other autoimmune diseases researchers at ucla developed a nanoparticle system with water soluble shell encapsulated a protein derived from bird anemia virus apoptin apoptin selectively sends self destruct signal to tumor cells and trigger the programmed cell death apoptosis as it builds up in the nucleus while leaving healthy cells unharmed in the mouse model of human breast cancer the treatment was found to significantly reduce the tumors growth this new form of treatment harming healthy cells a common pitfall of chemotherapy and no probability of genetic mutation that usually accompanies gene therapy a nano network of nanoparticles with a solid core of insulin modified dextran and glucose oxidase was demonstrated to be able to regulate and maintain normal blood sugar level in a mouse model with type 1 diabetes for up to 10 days the nanoparticle is coated with either the positively charged chitosan from shrimp shells or negatively charged alginate from seaweed the opposite charges hold the nanoparticles together as a nano network even after they are injected subcutaneously the porous particles allow blood to make contact with the nanoparticle cores when there is high blood sugar level glucose oxidase is activated and breaks down the dextran into gluconic acid the disintegration of the cores releases the insulin which controls the blood sugar level to the normal range cancer the small size of nanoparticles endows them with properties that can be very useful in oncology particularly in imaging quantum dots nanoparticles with quantum confinement properties in conjunction with mri magnetic resonance imaging can produce exceptional images of tumor sites these nanoparticles are much brighter than organic dyes and only need one light source for excitation this means that the use of fluorescent quantum dots could produce a higher contrast image and at a lower cost than today s organic dyes used as contrast media the downside however is that quantum dots are usually made of quite toxic elements another nanoproperty high surface area to volume ratio allows many functional groups to be attached to a nanoparticle which can seek out and bind to certain tumor cells additionally the small size of nanoparticles 10 to 100 nanometers allows them to preferentially accumulate at tumor sites because tumors lack an effective lymphatic drainage system research into multifunctional nanoparticles that would detect image and then proceed to treat a tumor is under way a promising new cancer treatment that may one day replace radiation and chemotherapy is edging closer to human trials kanzius rf therapy inside the body with radio waves that heat only the nanoparticles and the adjacent cancerous cells sensor test chips containing thousands of nanowires able to detect proteins and other biomarkers left behind by cancer cells could enable the detection and diagnosis of cancer in the early stages from a few drops of a patient s blood the basic point to use drug delivery is based upon three facts a efficient encapsulation of the drugs b successful delivery of said drugs to the targeted region of the body and c successful release of that drug there researchers at rice university under prof jennifer west have demonstrated the use of 120 nm diameter nanoshells coated with gold to kill cancer tumors in mice the nanoshells can be targeted to bond to cancerous cells by conjugating antibodies or peptides to the nanoshell surface by irradiating the area of the tumor with an infrared laser which passes through flesh without heating it the gold is heated sufficiently to cause death to the cancer cells limitations to and lack of solubility nanoparticles have the potential to overcome these problems nanoparticles of cadmium selenide quantum dots glow when exposed to ultraviolet light when injected they seep into cancer tumors the surgeon can see the glowing tumor and use it as a guide for more accurate tumor removal in photodynamic therapy a particle is placed within the body and is illuminated with light from the outside the light gets absorbed by the particle and if the particle is metal energy from the light will heat the particle and surrounding tissue light may also be used to produce high energy oxygen molecules which will chemically react with and destroy most organic molecules that are next to them like tumors this therapy is appealing for many reasons it does not leave a toxic trail of reactive molecules throughout the body chemotherapy because it is directed where only the light is shined and the particles exist photodynamic therapy has potential for a noninvasive procedure for dealing with diseases growth and tumors numerous therapeutic functions into a single platform by targeting specific tumor cells tissues and organs actually conde et al reported the evaluation of the inflammatory response and therapeutic sirna silencing via rgd nanoparticles in a lung cancer mouse model this study reported the use of sirna rgd gold nanoparticles capable of targeting tumor cells in two lung cancer xenograft mouse models resulting in successful and significant c myc oncogene downregulation followed by tumor growth inhibition and prolonged survival of the animals this delivery system can achieve translocation of sirna duplexes directly into the tumour cell cytoplasm and accomplish successful silencing of an oncogene expression actually rgd sirna aunps can target preferentially and be taken up by tumor cells via integrin v3 receptor mediated endocytosis with no cytotoxicity showing that can accumulate in tumor tissues overexpressing v3 integrins and selectively delivered c myc sirna to suppress tumor growth and angiogenesis surgery at rice university a flesh welder is used to fuse two pieces of chicken meat into a single piece the two pieces of chicken are placed dribbled along the seam an infrared laser is traced along the seam causing the two sides to weld together this could solve the difficulties and blood leaks caused when the surgeon tries to restitch the arteries that have been cut during a kidney or heart transplant the flesh welder could weld the artery perfectly visualization tracking movement can help determine how well drugs are being distributed or how substances are metabolized it is difficult to track a small group of cells throughout the body so scientists used to dye the cells these dyes needed to be excited by light of a certain wavelength in order for them to light up while different color dyes absorb different frequencies of light there was a need for as many light sources as cells a way around this problem is with luminescent tags these tags are quantum dots attached to proteins that penetrate cell membranes the dots can be random in size can be made of bio inert material and they demonstrate the nanoscale property that color is size dependent the frequency of light used to make a group of quantum dots fluoresce is an even multiple of the frequency required to make another group incandesce then both groups can be lit with a single light source they have also found a way to insert nanoparticles into the affected parts of the body so that those parts of the body will glow showing the tumor growth or shrinkage or also organ trouble tissue engineering nanotechnology may be able to help reproduce or repair damaged tissue tissue engineering makes use of artificially stimulated cell proliferation by using suitable nanomaterial based scaffolds and growth factors for example bones could be regrown on carbon nanotube scaffolds tissue engineering might replace today s conventional treatments like organ transplants or artificial implants advanced forms of tissue engineering may lead to life extension artificial bone composites are also being manufactured from nanocrystalline calcium phosphates antimicrobial effects nanoparticles can be used in combination therapy for decreasing antibiotic resistance or for their antimicrobial properties it has been shown that zinc oxide nanoparticles can decrease the antibiotic in vitro nanoparticles can interfere with the different proteins which are interacting in the antibiotic resistance or pharmacologic mechanisms of drugs another example is silver which has been used for the treatment of burns and chronic wounds antibacterial and antifungal properties of nanoparticles have widened their applications in medicine and dentistry immune response buckyballs have been investigated for the ability to interrupt the allergy immune response by preventing mast cells which cause allergic response from releasing histamine into the blood and tissues by binding to free radicals dramatically better than any anti oxidant currently available such as vitamin e in february 2013 university of pennsylvania researchers developed a way to prevent nano particles from triggering an immune system response which could aid the delivery of medicinal nanoparticles some time in future this is done by using the protein cd47 found on most mammalian cell membranes which binds to the sirpa in macrophages preventing an immune response from being triggered arthroscope nanotechnology is helping to advance the use of arthroscopes which are pencil sized devices that can do the surgeries with smaller incisions the smaller the incisions the faster the healing time which is better for the patients it is also helping to find a way to make an arthroscope smaller than a strand of hair diagnostic and medical devices nanotechnology on a chip is one more dimension of lab on a chip technology magnetic nanoparticles bound to a suitable antibody are used to label specific molecules structures or microorganisms gold nanoparticles tagged with short segments of dna can be used for detection of genetic sequence in a sample multicolor optical coding for biological assays has been achieved by embedding different sized quantum dots into polymeric microbeads nanopore technology for analysis of nucleic

frequently used in reinforcement learning as part of the overall algorithm dynamic programming has been coupled with anns neuro dynamic programming by bertsekas and tsitsiklis and applied to multi dimensional nonlinear problems such as those involved in vehicle routing natural resources management or medicine because of the ability of anns to mitigate losses of accuracy even when reducing the discretization grid density for numerically approximating the solution of the original control problems tasks that fall within the paradigm of reinforcement learning are control problems games and other sequential decision making tasks learning algorithms training a neural network model essentially means selecting one model from the set of allowed models or in a bayesian framework determining a distribution over the set of allowed models that minimizes the cost criterion there are numerous algorithms available for training neural network models most of them and statistical estimation most of the algorithms used in training artificial neural networks employ some form of gradient descent this is done by simply taking the derivative of the cost function with respect to the network parameters and then changing those parameters in a gradient related direction evolutionary methods these networks have also been used to diagnose prostate cancer the diagnoses can be used to make specific models taken from a large group of patients compared to information of one given patient the models do not depend on assumptions about correlations of different variables colorectal cancer has also been predicted using the neural networks neural networks could predict the outcome for a patient with colorectal cancer with more accuracy than the current clinical methods after training the networks could predict multiple patient outcomes from unrelated institutions neural networks and neuroscience theoretical and computational neuroscience is the field concerned with the theoretical analysis and the computational modeling of biological neural systems since neural systems are intimately related to cognitive processes and behavior the field is closely related to is to create models of biological neural systems in order to understand how biological systems work to gain this understanding neuroscientists strive to make a link between observed biological processes data biologically plausible mechanisms for neural processing and learning biological neural network models and theory statistical learning theory and information theory types of models many models are used in the field defined at different levels of abstraction and modeling different aspects of neural systems they range from models of the short term behavior of individual neurons models of how the dynamics of neural circuitry arise from interactions between individual neurons and finally to models of how behavior can arise from abstract neural modules that represent complete subsystems these include models of the long term and short term plasticity of neural systems and their relations to learning and memory from the individual neuron to the system level neural network software neural network software is used to simulate research develop and apply artificial neural networks biological neural networks and in some types of artificial neural networks artificial neural network types vary from those with only one or two layers of single direction logic to complicated multiinput many directional feedback loops and layers on the whole these systems use algorithms in their programming to determine control and organization of their functions most systems use weights to change the parameters of the throughput and the varying connections to the neurons artificial neural networks can be autonomous and learn by input from outside teachers or even self teaching from written in rules theoretical properties computational power the multi layer perceptron mlp is a universal function approximator as proven by the cybenko theorem however the proof is not constructive regarding the number of neurons required or the settings of the weights work by hava siegelmann and eduardo d sontag has provided a proof that a specific recurrent architecture with rational valued weights as opposed to full precision real number valued weights has the full power of a universal turing machine to detecting credit card fraud technology writer roger bridgman commented networks for instance are in the dock not only because they have been hyped to high heaven what has n t but also because you could create a successful net without understanding how it worked the bunch of numbers that captures its behaviour would in all probability be an opaque unreadable table valueless as a scientific resource in spite of his emphatic declaration that science is not technology dewdney seems here to pillory neural nets as bad science when most of those devising them are just trying to be good engineers an unreadable table that a useful machine could read would still be well worth having in response to this kind of criticism one should note that although it is true that analyzing what has been learned by an artificial neural network is difficult it is much easier to do so than to analyze what has been learned by a biological neural network furthermore researchers involved in exploring learning algorithms for neural networks are gradually uncovering generic principles which allow a learning machine to 2007 wrote an article regarding local vs non local learning as well as shallow vs deep architecture some other

works as a menhir sculptor and deliveryman and is asterix s best friend obelix is noted for his fatness the menhirs he carries around on his back and his superhuman strength he is the only gaul in asterix s village who is permanently superhumanly strong since he fell into a cauldron of magic potion when he was a baby because of obelix s already enormous strength he is not allowed to drink the magic potion ever again a ban he regards as being tremendously unfair other characteristics are his simplemindedness his love and care for his dog dogmatix his anger when someone refers to him as being fat his enthusiasm for hunting and eating wild boars and beating up romans his catchphrase is ils sont fous ces romains which translates into they are crazy those romans although he considers nearly every other nationality to actor grard depardieu in every asterix live action movie fatness well covered inspection he is a large man who does not see himself as fat preferring to call himself well covered or having a chest that has slipped a bit from asterix and the banquet onwardspreviously he had simply expressed ignorance of being fat such as when he merely commented that he wished he had known he was too fat to pose as a lion in asterix the gladiator obelix is so in denial over this matter that he usually does not even notice when other people refer to him as that fat one and often shows total confusion over which fat person people are referring to when he does understand the allusions are made on his behalf he flies into a rage and starts beating up the person who said it sometimes when he is in a bad mood just hearing the word fat even if it is not in reference to himcan quickly enrage him is one of the main causes of conflicts between asterix and obelix which leads to more developing conflicts in which they must work together once escalating to the point that obelix actually gave asterix amnesia when he hit him too hard during an argument asterix and the actress although they usually simply insult each other verbally they inevitably make up swiftly sometimes obelix can be so paranoic over the allusion of the word fat that he can even break the fourth wall with the mere mention of this visibly in asterix and the black gold when the narrator points out that their asterix and obelix s vessel was pulled like a big and fat fish obelix became clearly offended and yelled who is fat character obelix is asterix s closest friend they even have the same birthday although this is inconsistent with the comic obelix and co where only obelix s menhir delivery man his passions in life are hanging around with asterix hunting and eating wild boar making and carrying his menhirs and beating up roman legionnaries and occasionally collecting their helmets obelix has a little dog named dogmatix fr idfix whom he adores his parents live now in condate as seen in asterix and the actress and his distant cousin metallurgix a golden sickle maker lives in lutetia as seen in asterix and the golden sickle obelix s favourite food is roast wild boar which he usually hunts with asterix but he has a voracious appetite and will try eating nearly anything with few exceptions in asterix and obelix all at sea and asterix in britain he seems to not like boiled boar in fact he eats nuts and oysters in the shell and is completely oblivious to drugs spicy food and poison however when he consumes alcohol he gets very drunk very quickly as seen for example in asterix in britain where he enjoys sampling different barrels of wine trying to find a barrel containing magic potion or in asterix and the laurel wreath where both he and chief vitalstatistix get drunk during a banquet much to shame of the latter s wife impedimenta although he has his own house obelix is occasionally shown staying overnight at asterix s obelix owns the quarry where he chisels the menhirs himself it is never directly stated what the menhirs are used for though it is hinted that they are just oversized knick knacks however they are probably a running gag regarding the origins of the mystery surrounding menhirs in ancient europe with the joke being that obelix delivered them obelix usually trades the stones away for whatever he needs resulting in the village having a literal field of menhirs obelix is kind hearted but socially inept possibly because his strength means that he is still not completely aware of his own strength and almost invariably breaks any door he gently knocks on he is frequently used as a human battering ram for opening locked doors or breaking through walls similarly he is unaware that others do not share his superhuman strength and shows great surprise when others are crushed by what he calls a little menhir or when asterix attempts to explain to him that a small dog like dogmatix can not lift a menhir he also has little interest in subjects of formal education or intellectual pursuits since sheer strength usually solves his problems he generally leaves any decisions to asterix however obelix is not completely stupid in asterix and the normans he deduces from various clues that cacofonix the bard has gone to lutetia to pursue a career in popular music this unusual display of intelligence on obelix s part surprises getafix he also surprises asterix in asterix and definition of wild boar in conversation including the latin taxonomical classification he can also be quite dangerous when angered while cheerfully violent and enjoying a good fight obelix is far from brutal or sadistic he tends to view fighting as a game and is generally friendly and polite to the point of inappropriate courtesy towards his opponents he extends this benevolence even towards the romans whom he rarely seems to view as oppressors but more as less willing participants in his rough housing his other favored pastimes are dancing which he apparently is very good at and occasionally drinking goat s milk to excess as he rarely imbibes in alcohol like asterix obelix is a bachelor but he is easily smitten by a pretty face he harbours a hopeless crush on panacea the daughter of soporifix one of the other villagers and occasionally other young women most notably mrs geriatrix which enrages her husband however one may think that he will eventually find a the class act he is shown to be the founder of a long dynasty of french warriors that lasted well into the 20th century obelix s trademark phrase is these romans are crazy ils sont fous ces romains in the italian language strength unlike the other villagers obelix has no need to drink getafix the druid s magic potion that gives superhuman strength because he fell into the cauldron as a baby and its effect on him became permanent the story of that incident is told in how obelix fell into the magic potion when he was a little boy since this effect was not intended or expected getafix refuses to allow him even one more drop except under the direst circumstances either out of fear for his life or fear for the lives of others should the inattentive and uncoordinated strongman become any stronger which annoys obelix greatly in asterix and obelix all at sea it is revealed to stone exactly how much is not known but a whole cauldron will certainly do the trick this appears to only work on grown people as obelix did not turn to stone as a baby or may simply occur after drinking an excessive amount while still under the effects of a previous dose however in asterix and cleopatra getafix gives him a few drops to open a door in the great pyramid s labyrinth but he comments that he does not see much difference between before and after the potion though this is presumably because obelix is used to accomplishing any physical task with ease although it has been clearly stated by both getafix in asterix the gaul and asterix in asterix and the laurel wreath that the magic potion does not grant invulnerability but getafix has a potion for that but it is only mentioned in asterix the gaul as well as superhuman strength meaning that they could raw strength generally prevents the romans getting the chance to do so the same does not seem to be true of obelix he does not even notice when attackers attempt to knock him unconscious with blows to the head when roman spearheads are stuck in his bottom in asterix in corsica or when anyone else attempts to harm him in any way this may imply that obelix either by stupidity or ignorance simply does not notice or react to the pain that should be inflicted or that the potion has enhanced his overall strength since it has been shown to increase the drinker s endurance allowing them to run faster to such a point where his muscles allow him to effortlessly absorb the attacks in question most of the occasions where obelix demonstrates invulnerability include him being attacked physically rather than with sharp objects as in asterix and the magic carpet when an arrow accidentally hits his bottom and he yells in agony and thus showing that obelix is n t above physical pain it comes to the relationship between the gauls and the romans as far as he is concerned the more romans he can beat up the better and nobody should deny him this not even the selfish roman victims themselves in asterix in britain he dismisses the claim that the romans have invaded britain he believes that the britons dragged the romans over there in order to have all the fun for themselves during a rugby match obelix is bored until he sees how violent the game can get and is overjoyed recommending that they play rugby in gaul in asterix in corsica it is revealed that the villagers attack the romans at least once a year in order to celebrate the gaulish victory at gergovia when the romans leave their camps in order to avoid the attacks obelix sees this behaviour as crazy and detrimental to their friendly relationship in asterix and obelix all at sea he has a dream or nightmare as of gaul he s horrified at the idea of such a dream coming true he also declares that the idea of peace with the romans is offensive to the memory of vercingetorix far more likely is the fact that peace will mean that he will not be able to bash the romans anymore a prospect he dreads he then comments on the good sense of the romans in attacking the village although they were actually merely planning a parade to welcome an admiral the roman civil war between caesar and pompey features in both asterix the legionary and asterix and the actress when he witnesses a battle between roman troops obelix murmurs what a waste but this is not so much on the wasted lives as the fact that it means that he has fewer romans to bash himself portrayal grard depardieu portrays obelix in all four live action french films based on various comics the late jacques morel and jacques frantz voiced him in 1967 1968 and 2006 french versions of cartoons bernard bresslaw howard lew lewis brad garrett and rosey grier voiced him in english dubs of cartoons name obelix s name is a pun on the french word oblisque obelisk suggested by rotund physique and his habit of casually carrying heavy stone monuments menhir around with him in fact obelisk is also in both french and english a variant of the word obelus oble a typographical mark often found in a companion role to that of the asterisk after which his friend asterix is named medlineplus 001553 psychosis from the greek psyche mind soul and osis abnormal condition or derangement refers to an abnormal condition of the mind and is a generic psychiatric term for a mental state often described as involving a loss of contact with reality people suffering from psychosis are described as psychotic psychosis as a sign of a psychiatric disorder is a diagnosis of exclusion that is a new onset episode of psychosis is not considered a symptom of a psychiatric disorder until other relevant and known causes of psychosis are properly excluded medical and biological laboratory tests should exclude central nervous system diseases and injuries diseases and injuries of other organs psychoactive substances toxins and prescribed medications as causes of symptoms of psychosis before any psychiatric illness can be diagnosed in medical training psychosis as a sign of illness is often compared to fever since both can have multiple causes that are not readily apparent the relatively normal aberrant experiences through to the complex and catatonic expressions of schizophrenia and bipolar type 1 disorder in properly diagnosed psychiatric disorders where other causes have been excluded by extensive medical and biological laboratory tests psychosis is a descriptive term for the hallucinations delusions sometimes violence and impaired insight that may occur psychosis is generally given to noticeable deficits in normal behavior negative signs and more commonly to diverse types of hallucinations or delusional beliefs e g grandiosity delusions of persecution an excess in dopaminergic signalling is hypothesized to be linked to the symptom positive and negative symptoms many antipsychotic drugs accordingly target the dopamine system however meta analyses of placebo controlled trials of these drugs show either no significant difference in effects between drug and placebo or a moderate effect size suggesting that the pathophysiology of psychosis is much more complex than an overactive dopamine system people experiencing psychosis may exhibit some personality changes and thought disorder depending on its severity this may be accompanied by unusual or bizarre behavior as out daily life activities signs and symptoms people with psychosis may have one or more of the following hallucinations delusions catatonia or a thought disorder as described below impairments in social cognition also occur hallucinations a hallucination is defined as sensory perception in the absence of external stimuli hallucinations are different from illusions or perceptual distortions which are the misperception of external stimuli hallucinations may occur in any of the five senses and take on almost any form which may include simple sensations such as lights colors tastes and smells to experiences such as seeing and interacting with fully formed animals and people hearing voices and having complex tactile sensations auditory hallucinations particularly experiences of hearing voices are the most common and often prominent feature of psychosis hallucinated voices may talk about or to the person and may involve several speakers with distinct personalities auditory hallucinations tend to be particularly distressing when they are derogatory commanding or preoccupying always be a negative one one research study has shown that the majority of people who hear voices are not in need of psychiatric help the hearing voices movement has subsequently been created to support voice hearers regardless of whether they are considered to have a mental illness or not delusions psychosis may involve delusional beliefs some of which are paranoid in nature put simply delusions are false beliefs that a person holds on to without adequate evidence it can be difficult to change the belief even with evidence to the contrary common themes of delusions are persecutory person believes that others are out to harm him her grandiose person believing that he or she has special powers or skills etc depressed persons might have delusions consistent with their low mood e g delusions that they have sinned or have contracted serious illness etc karl jaspers has classified psychotic delusions into primary and secondary types primary delusions are of normal mental processes whereas secondary delusions are typically understood as being influenced by the person s background or current situation e g ethnicity also religious superstitious or political beliefs catatonia catatonia describes a profoundly agitated state in which the experience of reality is generally considered impaired there are two primary manifestations of catatonic behavior the classic presentation is a person who does not move or interact with the world in any way while awake this type of catatonia presents with waxy flexibility waxy flexibility is when someone physically moves part of a catatonic person s body and the person stays in the position even if it is bizarre and otherwise nonfunctional such as moving a person s arm straight up in the air and the arm staying there the other type of catatonia is more of an outward presentation of the profoundly agitated state described above it involves excessive and purposeless motor behavior as well as extreme mental preoccupation that prevents an intact experience of reality an example is someone walking with a level of mental preoccupation meaning not focused on anything relevant to the situation that was not typical of the person prior to the symptom onset in both types of catatonia there is generally no reaction to anything that happens outside of them it is important to distinguish catatonic agitation from severe bipolar mania although someone could have both thought disorders thought disorder describes an underlying disturbance to conscious thought and is classified largely by its effects on speech and writing affected persons show loosening of associations that is a disconnection and disorganization of the semantic content of speech and writing in the severe form speech becomes incomprehensible and it is known as word salad psychiatric disorder from a diagnostic standpoint organic disorders were those believed caused by physical illness affecting the brain that is psychiatric disorders secondary to other conditions while functional disorders were considered disorders of the functioning of the mind in the absence of physical disorders that is primary psychological or psychiatric disorders disorders arise from physical processes in this view the distinction between brain and mind and therefore between organic and functional disease is an artificial one subtle physical abnormalities have been found in illnesses traditionally considered functional such as schizophrenia the dsm iv tr avoids the functional organic distinction and instead lists traditional psychotic illnesses psychosis due to general medical conditions and substance induced psychosis primary psychiatric causes of psychosis include the following schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder affective mood disorders including severe depression and severe depression or mania in bipolar disorder manic depression people experiencing a psychotic episode in the context of depression may experience persecutory or self blaming delusions or hallucinations while people experiencing a psychotic episode in the context of mania may form grandiose delusions schizoaffective disorder involving symptoms of both schizophrenia and mood disorders brief psychotic disorder or acute transient psychotic disorder delusional disorder persistent delusional disorder chronic hallucinatory psychosis psychotic symptoms may also be seen in schizotypal disorder certain personality disorders schizoid personality disorder and borderline personality disorder major depressive disorder in its severe form although it is possible and more likely to have severe depression without psychosis bipolar disorder in severe mania and or severe depression although it is possible to have severe mania and or severe depression without psychosis as well in fact that is more commonly the case post traumatic stress disorder induced delusional disorder sometimes in obsessive compulsive disorder dissociative disorders due to many overlapping symptoms careful differential diagnosis includes especially dissociative identity disorder stress is known to contribute to and trigger psychotic states a history of psychologically traumatic events and the recent experience of a stressful event can both contribute to the development of psychosis short lived psychosis triggered by stress is known as brief reactive psychosis and patients may spontaneously recover normal functioning within two weeks in some rare cases individuals may remain in a state of full blown psychosis for many years or perhaps have attenuated psychotic symptoms such as low intensity hallucinations present at most times without any psychiatric disease causes or triggers include falling asleep and waking hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations which are entirely normal bereavement in which hallucinations of a deceased loved one are common severe sleep deprivation sensory deprivation and sensory impairment caffeine intoxication extremely stressful event subtypes subtypes of psychosis include menstrual psychosis including circa mensual approximately monthly periodicity in rhythm with the menstrual cycle postpartum psychosis occurring recently after childbirth monothematic delusions myxedematous psychosis occupational psychosis stimulant psychosis tardive psychosis shared psychosis cycloid psychosis cycloid psychosis cycloid psychosis is psychosis that progresses from normal to full blown usually within a few hours not related to drug intake or brain injury in addition diagnostic criteria include at least four of the following symptoms confusion mood incongruent delusions hallucinations pan anxiety a severe anxiety not bound to particular situations or circumstances happiness or ecstasy of high degree motility disturbances of akinetic or hyperkinetic type concern with than what is needed for diagnosis of an affective disorder cycloid psychosis occurs in people of generally 1550 years of age causes many causes of schizophrenia are also causes of psychosis medical conditions a very large number of medical conditions can cause psychosis sometimes called secondary psychosis examples include disorders causing delirium toxic psychosis in which consciousness is disturbed neurodevelopmental disorders and chromosomal abnormalities including velocardiofacial syndrome neurodegenerative disorders such as alzheimer s disease dementia with lewy bodies and parkinson s disease focal neurological disease such as stroke brain tumors multiple sclerosis and some forms of epilepsy malignancy typically via masses in the brain paraneoplastic syndromes or drugs used to treat cancer infectious and postinfectious syndromes including infections causing delirium viral encephalitis hiv malaria lyme disease syphilis endocrine disease such as hypothyroidism hyperthyroidism adrenal failure cushing s syndrome and sometimes childbirth can provoke psychosis termed puerperal psychosis inborn errors of metabolism such as succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency porphyria and metachromatic leukodystrophy nutritional deficiency such as vitamin b sub 12 sub deficiency other acquired metabolic disorders including electrolyte disturbances such as hypocalcemia hypernatremia hyponatremia hypokalemia hypomagnesemia hypermagnesemia hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia but also hypoglycemia hypoxia and failure of the liver or kidneys autoimmune and related disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus lupus sle sarcoidosis hashimoto s encephalopathy and anti nmda receptor encephalitis poisoning by therapeutic drugs see below recreational drugs see below and a range of plants fungi metals organic compounds and a few animal toxins some sleep disorders including hallucinations in narcolepsy in which rem sleep intrudes into wakefulness psychosis can even be caused by familiar ailments such as flu or mumps psychoactive drugs various psychoactive substances both legal and illegal have been implicated in causing users this may be upon intoxication for a more prolonged period after use or upon withdrawal individuals who have a substance induced psychosis tend to have a greater awareness of their psychosis and tend to have higher levels of suicidal thinking compared to individuals who have a primary psychotic illness drugs that can induce psychotic symptoms include cannabis cocaine amphetamines cathinones psychedelic drugs such as lsd and psilocybin opioid receptor agonists such as enadoline and salvinorin a and nmda receptor antagonists such as phencyclidine and ketamine alcohol approximately three percent of people who are suffering from alcoholism experience psychosis during acute intoxication or withdrawal alcohol related psychosis may manifest itself through a kindling mechanism the mechanism of alcohol related psychosis is due to the long term effects of alcohol resulting in distortions to neuronal membranes gene expression as well as thiamin deficiency it is possible in some cases that alcohol abuse via a kindling mechanism can cause the development of a chronic substance induced psychotic disorder i e schizophrenia risk of depression and suicide as well as causing psychosocial impairments cannabis according to some studies the more often cannabis is used the more likely a person is to develop a psychotic illness with frequent use being correlated with twice the risk of psychosis and schizophrenia while cannabis use is accepted as a contributory cause of schizophrenia by some it remains controversial with pre existing vulnerability to psychosis emerging as the key factor that influences the link between cannabis use and psychosis some studies indicate that the effects of two active compounds in cannabis tetrahydrocannabinol thc and cannabidiol cbd have opposite effects with respect to psychosis while thc can induce psychotic symptoms in healthy individuals cbd may reduce the symptoms caused by cannabis cannabis use has increased dramatically over the past few decades whereas the rate of psychosis has not increased together these findings suggest that cannabis use may hasten the onset of psychosis in those who may already be predisposed to psychosis high potency cannabis use indeed seems to accelerate the concluded that cannabis plays an important role in the development of psychosis in vulnerable individuals and that cannabis use in early adolescence should be discouraged methamphetamine methamphetamine induces a psychosis in 26 46 percent of heavy users some of these people develop a long lasting psychosis that can persist for longer than six months those who have had a short lived psychosis from methamphetamine can have a relapse of the methamphetamine psychosis years later after a stress event such as severe insomnia or a period of heavy alcohol abuse despite not relapsing back to methamphetamine individuals who have long history of methamphetamine abuse and who have experienced psychosis in the past from methamphetamine abuse are highly likely to rapidly relapse back into a methamphetamine psychosis within a week or so of going back onto methamphetamine medication administration or sometimes withdrawal of a large number of medications may provoke psychotic symptoms drugs that can induce psychosis experimentally and or in a significant proportion of patients include amphetamine and other sympathomimetics dopamine agonists ketamine corticosteroids often with mood changes in addition a 2014 study found no evidence that familial risk accounts for associations between childhood physical abuse and psychotic disorder or that it substantially increases the odds of psychosis among individuals reporting abuse diagnosis researchers at the university of edinburgh have demonstrated that structural and functional mri can detect changes in the brain that precede the onset of diagnosis and could potentially be used as a diagnostic aid pathophysiology the first brain image of an individual with psychosis was completed as far back as 1935 using a technique called pneumoencephalography a painful and now obsolete procedure where cerebrospinal fluid is drained from around the brain and replaced with air to allow the structure of the brain to show up more clearly on an x ray picture the purpose of the brain is to collect information from the body pain hunger etc and from the outside world interpret it to a coherent world view and produce a meaningful response the information from the senses enter the brain in the primary sensory areas they process the information is interpreted spontaneous activity in the primary sensory areas may produce hallucinations which the secondary areas misinterpret as information from the real world for example a pet or fmri scan of a person who claims he hears voices may show activation in the primary auditory cortex or parts of the brain involved in the perception and understanding of speech tertiary brain cortex collects the interpretations from the secondary cortexes and creates a coherent world view of it a study investigating structural changes in the brains of people with psychosis showed there was significant grey matter reduction in the right medial temporal lateral temporal and inferior frontal gyrus and in the cingulate cortex bilaterally of people before and after they became psychotic findings such as these have led to debate about whether psychosis itself causes excitotoxic brain damage and whether potentially damaging changes to the brain are related to the length of psychotic episode recent research has suggested that this is not the case although further investigation is still ongoing studies with sensory deprivation have shown that to function properly if the spontaneous activity in the brain is not counterbalanced with information from the senses loss from reality and psychosis may occur after some hours a similar phenomenon is paranoia in the elderly when poor eyesight hearing and memory make the person abnormally suspicious of the environment on the other hand loss from reality may also occur if the spontaneous cortical activity is increased so that it is no longer counterbalanced with information from the senses the 5 ht2a receptor seems to be important for this since psychedelic drugs that activate them produce hallucinations however the main feature of psychosis is not hallucinations but the inability to distinguish between internal and external stimuli close relatives to psychotic patients may hear voices but since they are aware that they are unreal they can ignore them so that the hallucinations do not affect their reality perception hence they are not considered psychotic psychosis has been traditionally linked to the neurotransmitter dopamine in particular the dopamine hypothesis of psychosis has been influential and in the brain particularly in the mesolimbic pathway the two major sources of evidence given to support this theory are that dopamine receptor d2 blocking drugs i e antipsychotics tend to reduce the intensity of psychotic symptoms and that drugs that boost dopamine activity such as amphetamines and cocaine can trigger psychosis in some people see amphetamine psychosis however increasing evidence in recent times has pointed to a possible dysfunction of the excitory neurotransmitter glutamate in particular with the activity of the nmda receptor this theory is reinforced by the fact that dissociative nmda receptor antagonists such as ketamine pcp and dextromethorphan at large overdoses induce a psychotic state more readily than dopaminergic stimulants even at normal recreational doses the symptoms of dissociative intoxication are also considered to mirror the symptoms of schizophrenia including negative psychotic symptoms more closely than amphetamine psychosis dissociative induced psychosis happens on a more reliable and predictable basis than amphetamine psychosis which usually only occurs in cases of overdose prolonged use or new antipsychotic drugs that act on glutamate and its receptors are currently undergoing clinical trials the connection between dopamine and psychosis is generally believed complex while dopamine receptor d2 suppresses adenylate cyclase activity the d1 receptor increases it if d2 blocking drugs are administered the blocked dopamine spills over to the d1 receptors the increased adenylate cyclase activity affects genetic expression in the nerve cell which takes time hence antipsychotic drugs take a week or two to reduce the symptoms of psychosis moreover newer and equally effective antipsychotic drugs actually block slightly less dopamine in the brain than older drugs whilst also blocking 5 ht2a receptors suggesting the dopamine hypothesis may be oversimplified soyka and colleagues found no evidence of dopaminergic dysfunction in people with alcohol induced psychosis and zoldan et al reported moderately successful use of ondansetron a 5 ht sub 3 sub receptor antagonist in the treatment of levodopa psychosis in parkinson s disease patients psychiatrist david healy has criticised pharmaceutical companies for promoting simplified biological theories of mental illness that seem to imply the primacy are known important influences in the aetiology of psychosis some theories believe many psychotic symptoms are a problem with the perception of ownership of internally generated thoughts and experiences for example the hallucination of hearing voices may arise from internally generated speech that is mislabeled by the psychotic person as coming from an external source it has been suggested that persons with bipolar disorder may have increased activity of the left hemisphere compared to the right hemisphere of the brain while persons with schizophrenia have increased activity in the right hemisphere increased level of right hemisphere activation has also been found in people who have high levels of paranormal beliefs and in people who report mystical experiences it also seems that people who are more creative are also more likely to show a similar pattern of brain activation some researchers have been quick to point out that this in no way suggests that paranormal mystical or creative experiences are in any way by themselves a symptom of mental illness as it is still not clear what makes in otherwise normal individuals exogenous ligands can produce psychotic symptoms nmda receptor antagonists such as ketamine can produce a similar psychosis to that experienced in schizophrenia prolonged or high dose use of psychostimulants can alter normal functioning making it similar to the manic phase of bipolar disorder nmda antagonists replicate some of the so called negative symptoms like thought disorder in subanesthetic doses doses insufficient to induce anesthesia and catatonia in high doses psychostimulants especially in one already prone to psychotic thinking can cause some positive symptoms such as delusional beliefs particularly those persecutory in nature diagnosis psychosis is first and foremost a diagnosis of exclusion so a new onset episode of psychosis can not be considered a symptom of a psychiatric disorder until other relevant and known causes of psychosis are properly excluded or ruled out many clinicians improperly perform or entirely miss this step introducing avoidable diagnostic error and misdiagnosis an initial assessment includes a comprehensive history and physical examination by a assistant biological tests should be performed to exclude psychosis associated with or caused by substance use medication toxins surgical complications or other medical illnesses delirium should be ruled out which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness indicating other underlying factors including medical illnesses excluding medical illnesses associated with psychosis is performed by using blood tests to measure thyroid stimulating hormone to exclude hypo or hyperthyroidism basic electrolytes and serum calcium to rule out a metabolic disturbance full blood count including esr to rule out a systemic infection or chronic disease and serology to exclude syphilis or hiv infection other investigations include eeg to exclude epilepsy and an mri or ct scan of the head to exclude brain lesions because psychosis may be precipitated or exacerbated by common classes of psychiatric medications such as antidepressants adhd stimulant medications and sleep medications medication induced psychosis should be ruled out particularly for first episode psychosis both substance and medication induced using a urinalysis and a full serum toxicology screening because some dietary supplements may also induce psychosis or mania but can not be ruled out with laboratory tests a psychotic individual s family partner or friends should be asked whether the patient is currently taking any dietary supplements common mistakes made when diagnosing people who are psychotic include not properly excluding delirium not appreciating medical abnormalities e g vital signs not obtaining a medical history and family history indiscriminate screening without an organizing framework missing a toxic psychosis by not screening for substances and medications not asking family or others about dietary supplements premature diagnostic closure and not revisiting or questioning the initial diagnostic impression of primary psychiatric disorder only after relevant and known causes of psychosis are excluded a mental health clinician may make a psychiatric differential diagnosis using a person s family history incorporating information from the person with psychosis and information from family psychiatric disorders may be established by formal rating scales the brief psychiatric rating scale bprs assesses the level of 18 symptom constructs of psychosis such as hostility suspicion hallucination and grandiosity it is based on the clinician s interview with the patient and observations of the patient s behavior over the previous 23 days the patient s family can also answer questions on the behavior report during the initial assessment and the follow up both positive and negative symptoms of psychosis can be assessed using the 30 item positive and negative symptom scale panss prevention the evidence for the effectiveness of early interventions to prevent psychosis appeared inconclusive whilst early intervention in those with a psychotic episode might improve short term outcomes little benefit was seen from these measures after five years however there is evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy cbt may reduce the risk of becoming psychotic in those at high risk and in 2014 the uk national institute for health and care excellence nice recommended preventive cbt treatment of psychosis depends on the specific diagnosis such as schizophrenia bipolar disorder or substance intoxication the first line treatment for many psychotic disorders is antipsychotic medication oral or intramuscular injection and sometimes hospitalization is needed however there are significant problems associated with this class of drugs there is evidence that they can cause brain damage including prefrontal cortex atrophy long lasting parkinsonian symptoms tardive dyskinesia and personality change nancy andreasen has argued for an association between antipsychotic drugs and smaller grey matter volumes independent of illness severity furthermore antipsychotic drugs can themselves induce psychotic symptoms if they are administered for a long time and then discontinued there is growing evidence that cognitive behavior therapy acceptance and commitment therapy and family therapy can be effective in managing psychotic symptoms when other treatments for psychosis are ineffective electroconvulsive therapy or ect also known as shock treatment is sometimes applied to relieve the underlying symptoms of psychosis due to depression there is also increasing research suggesting that animal assisted therapy can schizophrenia early intervention early intervention in psychosis is on the observation that identifying and treating someone in the early stages of a psychosis can improve their longer term outcome this approach advocates the use of an intensive multi disciplinary approach during what is known as the critical period where intervention is the most effective and prevents the long term morbidity associated with chronic psychotic illness history the word psychosis was introduced to the psychiatric literature in 1841 by karl friedrich canstatt in his work handbuch der medizinischen klinik he used it as a shorthand for psychic neurosis at that time neurosis meant any disease of the nervous system and canstatt was thus referring to what was considered a psychological manifestation of brain disease ernst von feuchtersleben is also widely credited as introducing the term in 1845 as an alternative to insanity and mania the term stems from the greek psychosis a giving soul or life to psyche soul and the suffix osis in this case abnormal condition the word was also used to distinguish a condition considered a disorder of the mind as opposed to neurosis which was considered a disorder of the nervous system the psychoses thus became the modern equivalent of the old notion of madness and hence there was much debate on whether there was only one unitary or many forms of the new disease one type of broad usage would later be narrowed down by koch in 1891 to the psychopathic inferiorities later renamed abnormal personalities by schneider the division of the major psychoses into manic depressive illness now called bipolar disorder and dementia praecox now called schizophrenia was made by emil kraepelin who attempted to create a synthesis of the various mental disorders identified by 19th century psychiatrists by grouping diseases together based on classification of common symptoms kraepelin the whole spectrum of mood disorders in a far wider sense than it is usually used today in kraepelin s classification this would include unipolar clinical depression as well as bipolar disorder and other mood disorders such as cyclothymia these are characterised by problems with mood control and the psychotic episodes appear associated with disturbances in mood and patients often have periods of normal functioning between psychotic episodes even without medication schizophrenia is characterized by psychotic episodes that appear unrelated to disturbances in mood and most non medicated patients show signs of disturbance between psychotic episodes during the 1960s and 1970s psychosis was of particular interest to counterculture critics of mainstream psychiatric practice who argued that it may simply be another way of constructing reality and is not necessarily a sign of illness for example r d laing argued that psychosis is a symbolic way of expressing concerns in situations where such views may be unwelcome or uncomfortable to the recipients he went on to say that psychosis could be also seen as a transcendental experience with of the term mystical psychosis to characterize first person accounts of psychotic experiences that are similar to reports of mystical experiences thomas szasz focused on the social implications of labeling people as psychotics a label he argues unjustly medicalises different views of reality so such unorthodox people can be controlled by society psychoanalysis has a detailed account of psychosis that differs markedly from that of psychiatry freud and lacan outlined their perspective on the structure of psychosis in a number of works since the 1970s the introduction of a recovery approach to mental health which has been driven mainly by people who have experienced psychosis or whatever name is used to describe their experiences has led to a greater awareness that mental illness is not a lifelong disability and that there is an expectation that recovery is possible and probable with effective support treatment early civilizations considered madness a supernaturally inflicted phenomenon archaeologists have unearthed skulls with clearly visible drillings some datable back to 5000 bc suggesting that trepanning was a common treatment for psychosis resultant treatments can be traced back to the new testament mark 5 8 13 describes a man displaying what would today be described as psychotic symptoms christ cured this demonic madness by casting out the demons and hurling them into a herd of swine exorcism is still utilized in some religious circles as a treatment for psychosis presumed to be demonic possession a research study of out patients in psychiatric clinics found that 30 per cent of religious patients attributed the cause of their psychotic symptoms to evil spirits many of these patients underwent exorcistic healing rituals that though largely regarded as positive experiences by the patients had no effect on symptomology results did however show a significant worsening of psychotic symptoms associated with exclusion of medical treatment for coercive forms of exorcism the medical teachings of the fourth century philosopher and physician hippocrates of cos proposed a natural rather than supernatural cause of human illness in hippocrates work the hippocratic corpus a holistic explanation for health and disease was developed to include madness and espoused a theory of humoralism wherein disease is resultant of a shifting balance in bodily fluids including blood phlegm black bile and yellow bile according to humoralism each fluid or humour has temperamental or behavioral correlates in the case of psychosis symptoms are thought to be caused by an excess of both blood and yellow bile thus the proposed surgical intervention for psychotic or manic behavior was bloodletting 18th century physician educator and widely considered founder of american psychiatry benjamin rush also prescribed bloodletting as a first line treatment for psychosis although not a proponent of humoralism rush believed that active purging and bloodletting were efficacious corrections for disruptions in the circulatory system a complication he believed was the primary cause of insanity although rush s treatment modalities are now considered antiquated and brutish his contributions to psychiatry namely the biological underpinnings of psychiatric phenomenon including psychosis have been invaluable to the field in honor of such contributions benjamin rush s image is in the official seal of the american persisting psychosis were characterized by an emphasis on shocking the nervous system such therapies include insulin shock therapy cardiazol shock therapy and electroconvulsive therapy despite considerable risk shock therapy was considered highly efficacious in the treatment of psychosis including schizophrenia the acceptance of high risk treatments led to more invasive medical interventions including psychosurgery in 1888 swiss psychiatrist gottlieb burckhardt performed the first medically sanctioned psychosurgery in which the cerebral cortex was excised although some patients showed improvement of symptoms and became more subdued one patient died and several developed aphasia and or seizure disorders burckhardt would go on to publish his clinical outcomes in a scholarly paper this procedure was met with criticism from the medical community and his academic and surgical endeavors were largely ignored in the late 1930s egas moniz conceived the leucotomy aka prefrontal lobotomy in which the fibers connecting the frontal lobes to the rest of the brain were severed monizs primary inspiration stemmed from a demonstration by neuroscientists john fulton and carlyles 1935 experiment in which two was compared prior to the leucotomy the chimps engaged in typical behavior including throwing feces and fighting after the procedure both chimps were pacified and less violent during the q amp a moniz asked if such a procedure could be extended to human subjects a question that fulton admitted was quite startling moniz would go on to extend the controversial practice to humans suffering from various psychotic disorders an endeavor for which he received a nobel prize in 1949 between the late 1930s and early 1970s the leucotomy was a widely accepted practice often performed in non sterile environments such as small outpatient clinics and patient homes psychosurgery remained standard practice until the discovery of antipsychotic pharmacology in the 1950s the first clinical trial of antipsychotics also commonly known as neuroleptics for the treatment of psychosis took place in 1952 chlorpromazine brand name thorazine passed clinical trials and became the first antipsychotic medication approved for the treatment of both acute and chronic psychosis although the mechanism of action was not discovered until 1963 dopamine antagonist or first generation antipsychotic while clinical trials showed a high response rate for both acute psychosis and disorders with psychotic features the side effects were particularly harsh which included high rates of often irreversible parkinsonian symptoms such as tardive dyskinesia with the advent of atypical antipsychotics also known as second generation antipsychotics came a dopamine antagonist with a comparable response rate but a far different though still extensive side effect profile that included a lower risk of parkinsonian symptoms but a higher risk of cardiovascular disease atypical antipsychotics remain the first line treatment for psychosis associated with various psychiatric and neurological disorders including schizophrenia bipolar disorder major depressive disorder anxiety disorders dementia and some autism spectrum disorders it is now known that dopamine is the primary neurotransmitter implicated in psychotic symptomology thus blocking dopamine receptors namely the dopamine d2 receptors and decreasing dopaminergic activity continues to be an effective but highly unrefined pharmacologic goal of antipsychotics recent pharmacological research suggests that the decrease in dopaminergic activity does not eradicate psychotic involved in the development of delusional thinking that is connecting or finding meaningful relationships between unrelated stimuli or ideas the author of this research paper acknowledges the importance of future investigation birthplace zolochiv

letters emeritus at cornell university in ithaca new york early life escape from the holocaust hoffmann was born in zolochiv poland now ukraine to a jewish family and was named in honor of the norwegian explorer roald amundsen his parents were clara rosen a teacher and hillel safran a civil engineer after germany invaded poland and occupied the town his family was placed in a labor camp where his father who was familiar with much of the local infrastructure was a valued prisoner as the situation grew more dangerous with prisoners being transferred to liquidation camps the family bribed guards to allow an escape and arranged with ukrainian neighbors for hoffman his mother attic and a storeroom of the local schoolhouse where they remained for fifteen months while hoffman was aged 5 to 7 his father remained at the labor camp but was able to occasionally visit until he was tortured and killed by the germans for his involvement in a plot to arm the camp prisoners when she received the news his mother attempted to contain her sorrow by writing down her feelings in a notebook her husband had been using to take notes on a relativity textbook he had been reading while in hiding his mother kept hoffman entertained by teaching him to read and having him memorize geography from textbooks stored in the attic then quizzing him on it he referred to the experience as having been enveloped in a cocoon of love most of the rest of the family perished in the holocaust though one grandmother and a few others survived they migrated to the united states in 1949 hoffman visited zolochiv with his adult son by then a parent of a five year old in was still intact but the storeroom had been incorporated ironically enough into a chemistry classroom in 2009 a monument to holocaust victims was built in zolochiv on hoffmann s initiative academic credentials hoffmann graduated in 1955 from new york city s stuyvesant high school where he won a westinghouse science scholarship he received his bachelor of arts degree at columbia university columbia college in 1958 he earned his master of arts degree in 1960 from harvard university he earned his doctor of philosophy degree from harvard university while working under direction of subsequent 1976 nobel prize in chemistry winner william n lipscomb jr under lipscomb s direction the extended hckel method was developed by lawrence lohr and by roald hoffmann this method was later extended by hoffmann he went to cornell in 1965 and has remained there becoming professor emeritus chemistry interests hoffmann has investigated both organic and inorganic substances developing computational tools and methods such as the extended hckel method which he proposed in 1963 for elucidating reaction mechanisms the woodwardhoffmann rules

company a global pharmaceutical corporation the pogues are a celtic punk band from london formed in 1982 and fronted by shane macgowan the band reached international prominence in the 1980s and early 1990s macgowan left the band in 1991 due to drinking problems but the band continued first with joe strummer and then with spider stacy on vocals before breaking up in 1996 the band reformed in late 2001 and has been playing regularly ever since most notably on the us east coast around st patrick s day and across the uk and ireland every december the group has yet to record any new music and according to spider stacy on pogues com has no inclination to do so their politically tinged music was informed by macgowan and stacy s punk backgrounds yet used traditional irish instruments such as the tin whistle cittern mandolin and accordion the pogues were founded in kings cross a district of central london in 1982 as pogue mahone pogue mahone being the anglicisation of the irish pg band history the future members of the pogues first met when macgowan vocals peter spider stacy tin whistle and jem finer banjo were together in an occasional band called the millwall chainsaws in the late 1970s after macgowan and stacy met in the toilets at a ramones gig at the roundhouse in 1977 macgowan was already with the nips though when they broke up in 1980 he concentrated a bit more on stacy s millwall chainsaws who changed their name to the new republicans during this period macgowan and finer auditioned unsuccessfully for a licence to busk at covent garden in 1982 james fearnley accordion who had been a guitarist with the nips joined macgowan stacy and finer forming the band then known as pogue mahone the new group played their first gig at the pindar of wakefield on 4 october 1982 they then appeared at gossips in dean street soho on thursday 3 november with trash trash trash and the stingrays they later added the band played london pubs and clubs and released a single dark streets of london on their own self named label gaining a small reputationespecially for their live performances they came to the attention of the media and stiff records when they opened for the clash on their 1984 tour shortening their name to the pogues partly due to bbc censorship following complaints from gaelic speakers in scotland they released their first album red roses for me on stiff records that october the band gained more attention when the uk channel 4 s influential music show the tube made a video of their version of waxie s dargle for the show the performance featuring spider stacy repeatedly smashing himself over the head with a beer tray became a favourite with the viewers but stiff records refused to release it as a single feeling it was too late for it to help red roses for me nevertheless it remained a favourite request of punk and new wave forefather elvis costello they recorded the follow up rum sodomy amp the lash in 1985 during which time guitarist philip chevron joined the album title is a famous comment falsely attributed to winston churchill who was supposedly describing the true traditions of the british royal navy 2005 and 2006 in polls by music channel vh1 uk despite not achieving christmas number one when it was released it was also voted as the 27th greatest song never to reach uk 1 in another vh1 poll and also voted as the 84th greatest song of all time by bbc radio 2 listeners in the sold on song top 100 poll in 2007 the record was briefly censored by the bbc because of the word faggot being deemed potentially offensive to gay people following protests from listeners including the mother of kirsty maccoll the censorship was lifted the band was at the peak of its commercial success with both albums making the top 5 in the uk numbers 3 and 5 respectively to turn up for the opening dates of their 1988 tour of america and prevented the band from promoting their 1990 album hell s ditch so in 1991 the band sacked him vocal duties were for a time handled by joe strummer spider stacy took over permanently after strummer got sacked in spring 1992 after strummer s departure the remaining seven pogues recorded in 1993 waiting for herb which contained the band s third and final top twenty single tuesday morning which became their best selling single internationally terry woods and james fearnley then left the band and were replaced by david coulter and james mcnally respectively within months of their departures ill health forced phil chevron to leave the band he was replaced by his former guitar technician jamie clarke this line up recorded the band s seventh and final studio album pogue mahone the album was a commercial failure and following jem finer s decision to leave the time to call it quits according to shane macgowan amongst the reasons of the break up was disagreement concerning the political orientation of his songs the band not wanting to sing too obvious pro republican songs though some of their previous songs were already politically engaged for instance streams of whiskey is about the poet and ira member brendan behan soon after the break up shane macgowan recorded a song called paddy public enemy number one as a tribute to the republican leader dominic mcglinchey a former leader of the inla killed a few years before post breakup after the pogues break up the three

on irish folk a focal point the reviewer continued the set started off shaky macgowan singing of goin where streams of whiskey are flowin and looking like he d arrived there already he grew more lucid

character in publication history created by jim shooter and mike zeck the beyonder first appeared in secret wars 1 may 1984 as an unseen force he reappears in secret wars ii 1 july 1985 which was written by jim shooter and drawn by al milgrom fictional character biography secret wars the beyonder is the sum total of a parallel reality called the beyond realm or simply beyond hence the name beyonder this dimension is accidentally accessed by nebbishy lab technician owen reece part of the energy from the dimension escapes and imbues reece with near infinite powers which he wields as the villainous molecule man potentially one of the most powerful villains in the marvel universe the remaining energy of the pocket dimension apparently gains sentience and curiosity using its vast powers the beyonder creates a planet called battleworld out of pieces of various planets one such piece being a suburb of denver so that he can observe the never ending battle between good and evil that rages within humanity at large initially explaining the nature of the experiment to the involuntary participants the entity identifies itself only as i am from beyond the name beyonder is quickly applied by galactus and adopted by all others present galactus sensing that the beyonder could alleviate his perpetual hunger immediately and aggressively charges into the beyond realm through a dimensional rift followed by doctor doom who seeks power for his own purposes both are repelled but the information gathered by doom later enables him to use the body of the sound based villain klaw as a medium to steal the energies of galactus worldship and then the power of the beyonder itself with the beyonder s power doom constructs a high tower of golden stone as temporary quarters and then states that he has given up his ambitions for conquest instead simply being content with freeing his mother s soul from mephisto the beyonder s consciousness then possesses klaw s damaged mind and distracting him enough for the beyonder to steal his power back this story formed the basis of the first secret wars twelve issue limited series the series sold incredibly well with circulation reaching up to 750 000 copies per issue numbers reminiscent of the height of comic book sales during the golden age of comic books secret wars ii due to the high sales of the first series a second secret wars series the nine issue secret wars ii miniseries was published this series crossed over into almost every comic that marvel was publishing at the time intrigued by what he has witnessed during the first secret wars the beyonder comes to earth to walk among humans and study them and learn of human desire firsthand he creates a human body for himself originally this body resembles molecule man he also transforms a television writer named steward cadwell into thundersword finally the beyonder creates a form for himself based on that of captain lack of understanding of human biology and society which leads to numerous difficult situations some serious and some humorous for instance he needs to learn by example the difference between edible objects and non edible ones and needs to be toilet trained by spider man when he learns about the monetary system from luke cage the hero for hire he transforms the manhattan heroes for hire office building into gold as thanks for their assistance he later comes under the influence of a criminal named vinnie and becomes the head of a criminal cartel the beyonder then uses mind control to assume control over the entire earth only to relinquish control when he grows restless and frustrated with the lack of free will that the world now displays beyonder then transforms the elf algrim into kurse the beyonder became enamored with the beauty and power potential within singing superheroine dazzler resulting in a brief love affair on a train to new york the beyonder meets the mutant tabitha smith also known as boom boom thinking the beyonder abandons her but returns and takes her to xavier s school at the school tabitha is terrified when the teams of the x men and the new mutants fight the beyonder the beyonder takes her to a planet where the celestials are located there threatening to destroy the universe the beyonder fights and seemingly defeats a number of celestials fearful of a further battle taking place between the beyonder and the celestials tabitha demands to be returned to earth back on earth boom boom alerts the avengers about the beyonder summoning the beyonder boom boom thereby leads him into an ambush by the avengers fantastic four and other costumed champions the beyonder who had regarded boom boom as his only friend allows the avengers to defeat him but then leaves boom boom leaves during the battle the beyonder then acts in an attempt to preserve life throughout the universe by seemingly eliminating and then resurrecting the manifestation of death throughout the course of the series the demon mephisto win the favor of death mephisto sends an army of supervillains called the legion accursed to attack the beyonder who is saved by the thing the beyonder then fights the puma believing that the only purpose left in his life is to help the puma find his by allowing puma to become one with the universe and allow puma to slay him puma having been convinced of the beyonder s nature as a malicious threat but a casual comment by spider man about the beyonder s manipulations causes puma to lose faith in himself at the crucial moment and the beyonder survives unscathed the beyonder then feels the futility of all his efforts and decides to destroy the entire multiverse he starts by killing the new mutants he then battles phoenix the beyonder reconsiders destroying the multiverse and resurrects the new mutants realizing that he can never truly understand what its like to be mortal as long as he has his powers as a safety net he constructs a machine to leech and contain his powers turning him becomes fearful of being without his power and takes his power back from the machine intrigued by this new experience the beyonder tries to create for himself a mortal human infant body that can retain his omnipotence but will allow him to grow and learn at a normal rate although he is on the verge of succeeding he is killed in the process by the molecule man the beyonder s near limitless power is returned to the now empty beyond realm where it forms a big bang and creates a new universe deadpool team up long after the secret wars ii crossover had ended a deadpool special featured the secret wars ii continues in this issue corner tag that was used during that original storyline in this issue a younger less experienced deadpool is hired by the kingpin to kill the beyonder the flashback sequence ends with deadpool chasing him into a portal with a footnote saying to be continued in secret wars iii this storyline has yet to be followed up on kosmos years later when it is revealed that the energy which comprises the beyonder and the energy that gives the molecule man his powers needs to be combined in order to create the basis for a mentally stable mature nigh omnipotent being to be born the beyonder then merges with the molecule man this being called kosmos marvel comics at some unknown point kosmos goes mad and assumes a mortal form now calling itself the maker after the now amnesiac maker destroys a shi ar colony the imperial guard manage to imprison it in the interstellar prison called the kyln the maker s madness takes control of several inmates but is finally subdued by the nihilist thanos and several of his allies among the prisoners thanos confronts the maker and by refusing to reveal its origins at a critical juncture manipulates it to psychically shut down its own mind thanos instructs the shi ar that the body should be kept alive but brain dead or the beyonder essence would go free again apparently thanos had never been explained as thanos was dead at the time of secret wars ii thanos flashback showed thanos as a youngster beyond and annihilation the beyonder returned in the series named after him beyond this being was called the beyonder in the second issue this beyonder is once again in command of the patchwork battleworld where it is revealed that he has been collecting various superhumans and pitting them in combat with one another eventually the pool of heroes and villains featured in the mini series discovers that this beyonder is actually the stranger who has been conducting studies of super humanity through re creations of the original secret war in the annihilation crossover the former herald of galactus the fallen one now under the control of thanos is sent to investigate the aftermath of the kyln s destruction by the annihilation wave and ascertain the beyonder s fate the fallen one soon finds the lifeless form of kosmos in the rubble new avengers the illuminati 3 featuring a retcon of past events charles xavier reveals that in the original secret war he had initially planned to use his powers to make everyone fall asleep and thus buy him and reed richards time to formulate an escape plan but feared the beyonder s wrath however he immediately sensed a strange mental presence and attempted to mind scan the beyonder revealing him as one of the inhumans previously ruled over by fellow illuminati member black bolt xavier also deduced the apparent secret behind the beyonder s seemingly godlike abilities which was that the beyonder was not only an inhuman but also a mutant like xavier and his own team of x men and the exposure of his mutant genes to terrigen mists had created an unprecedented reaction bestowing upon him more amazing power and knowledge than all other inhumans of his time this revelation leads to a confrontation with the beyonder during the events of the second secret war wherein black bolt expresses his extreme displeasure toward the beyonder s activities when encountered on ceres dwarf planet the story itself is deliberately ambiguous black bolt for example does not remember the mutant inhuman who vanished making it possible the beyonder arranged all this as a mind game as he had when he lived as a human and a mutant trying to find a purpose in his existence powers and abilities although not native to this dimension the beyonder was one of the absolute strongest and most powerful beings ever to exist in the marvel universe in the original secret wars storyline he was the be all and end all of the marvel universe that took human form to better understand the nature of human beings and capable of destroying the entire multiverse or the conceptual entity death itself after his creator jim shooter left marvel writer editor tom defalco displeased with shooter s tenure at marvel re tooled the beyonder and altered his origin he was no longer omnipotent as many initially believed being an incomplete cosmic cube with less raw power and the possessed vast psionic abilities allowing him to control and manipulate matter and energy at a cosmic level beyond all but the strongest and most powerful of cosmic entities he was shown and described to repel galactus like a bug and even greatly exceeded the collected energy of the latter s world ship he once destroyed a galaxy on a whim to meet his needs during the first secret wars and later by using his entire energies created a universe out of his own being when the molecule man extracted the beyonder from kosmos their battle took place in more than three dimensions and threatened vast portions of reality in kosmos maker incarnation she was stated as capable of reversing the crunch itself essentially collapsing the entire universe the beyonder could endow himself with a corporeal form of practically limitless strength and endurance however his scale of power has been claimed to be below that of the living tribunal and eternity the celestials or the molecule man when unfettered from his emotional timeline seen in guardians of the galaxy the beyonder provides guardian vance astro with a black undergarment resembling a symbiote in the alternate earth of mutant x comics mister mxyzptlk parodied the beyonder in his first appearance in the post crisis continuity by assuming a form and identity that was similar in clothing and appearance to the beyonder he called himself ben deroy an anagram of the name beyonder when asked by lois lane where he came from he answers by saying oh here and there yonder let s say yes yonder in the spider ham universe the bee yonder briefly appears to give spider ham a version of the black uniform stating that the familiar red and blue uniform was out of style in other media the beyonder makes an appearance in the spider man cartoon voiced by earl boen however his appearance in the cartoon greatly differs from his normal comics featuring the brief super hero costume the beyonder and a goatee as opposed to having a clean shaven face with a disco outfit he is also more of a neutral force than a villain the beyonder first appeared in the episode arrival of season 5 the first chapter of that secret wars in the series the beyonder worked with madame web to prepare spider man for the secret wars supposedly to see whether good was more powerful than evil he put spider man and a small group of heroes selected by the web slinger fantastic four captain america iron man storm and the black cat on a planet and pit them against a band of villains doctor octopus doctor doom alistair smythe the lizard and the red skull during this time doctor doom stole the beyonder s powers in doom the third and last chapter to the secret wars but he was defeated and it was implied that he had planned the whole ordeal out before it began the beyonder had all the heroes spider man had summoned to spider man however was needed for something bigger so he was the only one whose memory was untouched it was revealed that the evil spider carnage had destroyed the entire multiverse with a giant bomb however when the destruction reached the beyonder s own reality he used all of his powers to roll back time but since his powers were unlimited only in his own universe he would be unable to permanently undo spider carnage s actions himself though it tested him to the extreme he sent his servant madame web into the past to train spider men from many different realities to find out which one would be worthy enough to lead the others against spider carnage augustus iii ascends the throne bourbon territorial gains the war of the polish succession 17331738 was a major european war for princes possessions sparked by a polish civil war over the succession to augustus ii king of poland that other european powers widened in pursuit of their own national interests france and spain the two bourbon powers attempted to check the power of the austrian habsburgs in western europe as did the kingdom of prussia whilst saxony and russia mobilized to support the eventual polish victor the slight amount of fighting in poland resulted in the accession of augustus iii who in addition to russia and saxony was politically supported by the habsburgs the war s major military campaigns occurred outside poland the bourbons supported by charles emmanuel iii of sardinia moved against isolated habsburg territories in the rhineland france successfully took the duchy of lorraine and in italy spain regained control over the kingdoms of naples and sicily lost in the war of the spanish succession despite bloody campaigning great britain s unwillingness to support habsburg austria demonstrated major cracks in the anglo austrian alliance and may have contributed to austria s military failures although a preliminary peace was reached in 1735 the war was formally ended with the treaty of vienna 1738 in which augustus iii was confirmed as king of poland and his opponent stanisaw leszczyski who had received virtually no foreign military support was awarded the duchy of lorraine francis stephen the duke of lorraine was given the grand duchy of tuscany in compensation for the loss of lorraine the duchy of parma went to austria whereas charles of parma took the crowns of naples and sicily resulting in territorial gains for the bourbons poland also gave up claims to livonia and direct control over the duchy of courland and semigallia which although remaining a polish fief was not integrated into poland proper and came under strong russian influence background ever since the death of sigismund ii augustus in 1572 polish kings were elected great deal of power over the king but the sejms meetings of delegates to elect kings and conduct other business were in later years paralyzed by the institution of the liberum veto which gave any individual in the sejm the power to negate its decisions as a result poland s powerful neighbors were able to exert significant influence on the decision making process and by the early 18th century the system was in decline former polish king stanisaw leszczyski hoped to be elected king once again upon the death of his old adversary augustus ii of saxony who had failed in his attempts to make the polish crown hereditary within his family thirty years earlier stanisaw had been installed as king of poland by king charles xii of sweden during his period of dominance in the early part of the great northern war and was ousted following the battle of poltava by the victorious russians stanisaw was supported in his bid to regain the throne by his son in law king louis xv of france who hoped to to balance russian and austrian power in central northern and eastern europe in 1732 empress anna of russia holy roman emperor charles vi and king frederick william i of prussia irritated with augustus but unwilling to allow stanisaw to become king secretly signed lwenwolde s treaty in which they agreed to jointly back the candidacy of infante manuel of portugal for the polish throne france s prime minister cardinal fleury saw the polish struggle as a chance to strike at austrian power in the west without seeming to be the aggressor while he cared little for who should become king of poland the cause of protecting the king s father in law was a sympathetic one and he hoped to use the war as a means of humbling the austrians and perhaps securing the long desired duchy of lorraine from its duke francis stephen who was expected to marry emperor charles s daughter maria theresa which would bring austrian power dangerously close to the french border fleury s diplomatic moves would bring additional powers into the war spain and the charles emmanuel the king of sardinia who was also the duke of savoy death of augustus ii augustus ii died on february 1 1733 throughout the spring and summer of 1733 france began building up forces along its northern and eastern frontiers while the emperor massed troops on polish borders reducing garrisons in the duchy of milan for the purpose while the aging prince eugene of savoy had recommended to the emperor a more warlike posture against potential actions by france in the rhine valley and northern italy only minimal steps were taken to improve imperial defenses on the rhine the marquis de monti france s ambassador in warsaw convinced the rival potocki and czartoryski families to unite behind stanisaw teodor potocki primate of poland and interrex following the death of augustus called a convocation sejm in march 1733 delegates to this sejm passed a resolution forbidding the candidacy of foreigners this would explicitly exclude both emmanuel of portugal and augustus ii s son frederick august ii austria and russia in july 1733 in exchange for russian support he agreed to give up any remaining polish claims to livonia and promised to anna of russia her choice of successor to the duchy of courland a polish fief of which she had been duchess prior to her ascension to the russian throne which would have otherwise come under direct polish rule on the death of the current duke ferdinand kettler who had no heirs to the austrian emperor he promised recognition of the pragmatic sanction of 1713 a document designed to guarantee inheritance of the austrian throne to maria theresa charles oldest child in august polish nobles gathered for the election sejm on august 11 30 000 russian troops under field marshal peter lascy entered poland in a bid to influence the sejm s decision on september 4 france openly declared its support for leszczyski who was elected king by a sejm of 12 000 delegates on september 12 a group of nobles led by lithuanian magnates including duke michael ii crossed the vistula river to praga and the protection of russian troops this group numbering about 3 000 elected frederick august ii king of poland as augustus iii on october 5 despite the fact that this group was a minority russia and austria intent on maintaining their influence within poland recognised augustus as king on october 10 france declared war on austria and saxony louis xv was later joined by his uncle king philip v of spain who hoped to secure territories in italy for his sons by his second marriage to elizabeth farnese specifically he hoped to secure mantua for the elder son don carlos who was already duke of parma and had the expectation of the grand duchy of tuscany and the kingdoms of naples and sicily for the younger son don felipe the two bourbon monarchs were also joined by charles emmanuel of savoy who hoped to secure gains from the austrian duchies of milan and mantua austrian isolation when hostilities finally broke out powers great britain and the dutch republic they were disappointed in this since both the dutch and the british chose to pursue a policy of neutrality the british prime minister sir robert walpole justified britain s non intervention by insisting that the anglo austrian alliance agreed at the 1731 treaty of vienna was a purely defensive agreement while austria was in this instance the aggressor this position was attacked by english austrophiles who wanted to aid the austrians against france but walpole s dominant position ensured that britain stayed out of the conflict the french not wishing to provoke britain carefully chose not to campaign in the austrian netherlands and avoided campaigning in parts of the holy roman empire that might draw either power into the conflict on austria s southern border france in november 1733 negotiated the secret treaty of turin with charles emmanuel and prepared for military operations in northern italy it concluded the also secret treaty of the escorial with spain which included promises of french assistance in the spanish conquest of naples and the ottoman empire in a fruitless attempt to draw them into the conflict in support of stanisaw the austrians were thus left largely without effective external allies on their southern and western frontiers their russian and saxon allies were occupied with the polish campaign and the emperor distrusted frederick william i of prussia who was willing to provide some aid divisions within the empire also had an impact on the raising of troops in 1733 as charles albert of bavaria who harbored ambitions to become the next holy roman emperor signed a secret agreement with france in november 1733 and tried with limited success to dissuade other rulers within the empire from the wittelsbach family from providing troops to the emperor under their treaty obligations while britain itself did not provide support the electorate of hanover where george ii also ruled as an imperial elector proved willing to help war poland the russians led by lascy quickly took warsaw and installed augustus forcing stanisaw to flee to danzig time by a russian saxon army that came under the overall command of field marshal burkhard christoph von mnnich danzig capitulated in june 1734 and stanisaw fled first to knigsberg and eventually to france this ended major military activity in poland itself although it continued to be occupied by foreign troops as augustus dealt with partisan supporters of stanisaw a group of nobles supporting stanisaw formed the confederation of dzikow late in 1734 and under their commander adam taro tried to fight the russians and saxons but their efforts were ineffective in what became known as the pacification sejm held junejuly 1736 augustus was confirmed as king rhineland following france s october 10 declaration of war it began military operations three days later invading the duchy of lorraine and besieging the imperial fortress at kehl across the rhine river from strasbourg gaining control of both objectives in a few weeks unable to attack austria directly and unwilling to invade the intervening german states for fear of drawing great britain position in lorraine and withdrew its troops across the rhine for the winter the emperor mobilized his active forces in response to the french attacks and began the process of calling up troops from the states of the empire establishing a defensive line at ettlingen near karlsruhe in the spring of 1734 french maneuvers successfully flanked this line and prince eugene of savoy who despite being born in paris fought on the austrian side was forced to withdraw these forces to the imperial encampment at heilbronn this cleared the way for the french army under the duke of berwick to besiege the imperial fort at philippsburg which fell after a siege of two months in july 1734 eugene who was accompanied by crown prince frederick of prussia made some attempts to relieve the siege but never made any decisive attacks against the besieging army owing to its size and relatively poor quality of the troops under his command berwick was killed by a shell at philippsburg french armies continued to advance along the growing imperial army which came to include troops from russia that had assisted with the capture of danzig was able to prevent france from establishing a siege there and eugene went on the offensive a force of 30 000 under friedrich heinrich von seckendorff crossed the rhine and began pushing the french back toward trier defeating them at clausen in october 1735 in one of the last battles before preliminary peace terms were reached italy french and savoyard troops numbering over 50 000 under the command of charles emmanuel entered milanese territory as early as october 24 against minimal resistance as the austrian forces in the duchy numbered only about 12 000 by november 3 the city of milan itself had surrendered although the austrian governor count wirich philipp von daun still held the fortress france s great general the duke de villars joined charles emmanuel in milan on november 11 while villars wanted to immediately move to secure the alpine passes against austrian reinforcements by moving against mantua charles with spain sought to secure milan the army spent the next three months eliminating austrian opposition from the remaining fortified towns in the duchy villars attempted to interest don carlos of parma in joining the expedition against mantua but carlos was focused on the campaign into naples villars began to move against mantua but charles emmanuel resisted and the army made little progress in early may an austrian army of 40 000 under count claude florimond de mercy crossed the alps and threatened to close in on the french army s rear by a flanking maneuver villars responded by retreating from mantua and attempted without success to interrupt the austrian army s crossing of the po river villars frustrated by charles emmanuel s delaying tactics quit the army on may 27 he fell ill on the way back to france and died in turin on june 17 mercy s forces made repeated attempts to cross the parma river in june but it was not until late in that month that they were able to cross the allied forces now under the command of french marshals de broglie and coigny were entrenched in a bloody battle near the village of crocetta on june 29 the austrians were beaten back mercy was killed and frederick of wrttemberg his second was wounded charles emmanuel returned the next day to retake command and resumed his delaying tactics by failing to immediately pursue the retreating austrians the austrians retreated to the po where they were reinforced by additional troops and placed under the command of field marshal knigsegg after two months of inaction during which the armies faced each other across the secchia river knigsegg on september 15 took advantage of lax security and executed a raid on coigny s headquarters at quistello very nearly capturing coigny and taking among other prizes charles emmanuel s china two days later the french withdrew to a position near guastalla in response to austrian maneuvers but one detachment of nearly 3 000 men was surrounded and captured by the advancing austrians on september 19 knigsegg attacked encounter was beaten back losing among others frederick of wrttemberg knigsegg retreated across the po adopting a defensive position between the po and the oglio while charles emmanuel again did not capitalize on his victory when he finally withdrew most of the allied army to cremona the austrians advanced on the north bank of the po as far as the adda before both armies entered winter quarters in december 1734 in southern italy the austrians choosing a strategy of defending a large number of fortresses were soundly defeated don carlos assembled an army composed primarily of spaniards but also including some troops from france and savoy moving south through the papal states his army flanked the frontline austrian defense at mignano forcing them to retreat into the fortress at capua he was then practically welcomed into naples by the city fathers as the austrian viceroy had fled toward bari and the fortresses held by the austrians in the city were quickly captured while maintaining a blockade of the largest austrian holdings at army gave chase to the remaining austrian forces these finally attempted a stand in late may and were defeated at bitonto capua and gaeta were then properly besieged while austrian fortresses in sicily were quickly subdued gaeta surrendered in august and capua held out until november when its commander otto ferdinand von abensberg und traun finally negotiated surrender terms when he ran out of ammunition the jacobite pretender to the thrones of united kingdom and france charles edward stuart who was under 14 then also participated in the french and spanish siege of gaeta making his first exposure to battle the armies in northern italy suffered significantly over the winter with significant losses to disease and desertion for the 1735 campaign the allied forces in northern italy came under the command of the duke de noailles elevated to marshal after his successful contributions to the rhine campaign they were also joined by spanish forces in may now available after the successes in the south in response to this threat knigsegg retreated city of mantua well defended at this point divisions between the allies became clear as spain laid claim to mantua and also refused to guarantee milan to charles emmanuel in response charles emmanuel refused to allow his siege equipment to be used against mantua as a result the franco spanish army was unable to do more than blockade the city when charles emmanuel withdrew his forces from the area the allies were forced to retreat and the beleaguered austrians capitalized eventually recovering most of milan against little opposition in november peace settlement as early as february 1734 the british and dutch had offered to mediate peace talks between the various parties by early 1735 proposals were being circulated as 1735 progressed with the austrians being in no real position to continue the fight and the french concerned by the possible arrival of russian reinforcements on the rhine which did eventually occur negotiations continued through the summer of 1735 a preliminary peace was finally concluded in october 1735 and ratified in the as king of poland stanisaw was compensated with lorraine which would pass on his death through his daughter to the french while the former duke of lorraine francis stephen was made heir to the grand duchy of tuscany charles of parma gave up parma which came under direct austrian rule but he was richly compensated by being confirmed instead as king of naples and sicily although fighting stopped after the preliminary peace in 1735 the final peace settlement had to wait until the death of the last medici grand duke of tuscany gian gastone in 1737 to allow the territorial exchanges provided for by the peace settlement to go into effect the french and their allies hoping for dtente and good relations with the austrians now also recognized the pragmatic sanction that would allow emperor charles s daughter maria theresa to succeed him this proved a hollow guarantee however as the french decided to intervene to partition the habsburg monarchy after all following the death of charles in king however proved of lasting benefit to france as it passed under direct french rule with stanisaw s death in 1766 stanisaw signed the act of abdication in 1736 while augustus iii pronounced a general amnesty winiowiecki was rewarded the king made him the grand hetman commander in chief of lithuania notoc year 1838 mdcccxxxviii was a common year starting on monday link will

references depleted uranium du also referred to in the past as q metal depletalloy or d 38 is uranium with a lower content of the fissile isotope u 235 than natural uranium depleted uranium possesses only 60 of the radioactivity of natural uranium having been depleted of much of its most highly radioactive u sup 234 sup and u sup 235 sup isotopes natural uranium is about 0 72 u 235the fissile isotope and the du used by the u s department of defense contain less than 0 3 u 235 uses of du take advantage of its very high density of 19 1 g cm sup 3 sup 68 4 denser than lead civilian uses include counterweights in aircraft radiation shielding in medical radiation therapy and industrial radiography equipment and containers used to transport radioactive materials military uses include defensive armor plating and armor piercing projectiles most depleted uranium arises as a byproduct of the production of enriched uranium for use in nuclear reactors and in the manufacture of nuclear weapons enrichment processes generate uranium with a higher than natural concentration is the uranium isotope supporting the fission chain reaction with the bulk of the feed ending up as depleted uranium in some cases with mass fractions of u 235 and u 234 less than a third of those in natural uranium u 238 has a much longer halflife than the lighter isotopes and du therefore emits less alpha radiation than the same mass of natural uranium the us defense department states du used in us munitions has 60 of the radioactivity of natural uranium since the u 235 content of nuclear reactor fuel is reduced by fission uranium recovered by nuclear reprocessing from spent nuclear reactor fuel made from natural uranium will have a lower than natural u 235 concentration such reactor depleted material will have different isotopic ratios from enrichment byproduct du and can be distinguished from it by the presence of u 236 trace transuranics another indicator of the use of reprocessed material have been reported to be present in some us tank armor the use of du in munitions is controversial because of questions about potential long term health effects normal functioning and numerous other systems can be affected by uranium exposure because uranium is a toxic metal it is only weakly radioactive because of its long radioactive half life 4 468 billion years for uranium 238 700 million years for uranium 235 the biological half life the average time it takes for the human body to eliminate half the amount in the body for uranium is about 15 days the aerosol or spallation frangible powder produced during impact and combustion of depleted uranium munitions can potentially contaminate wide areas around the impact sites leading to possible inhalation by human beings the actual level of acute and chronic toxicity of du is also a point of medical controversy several studies using cultured cells and laboratory rodents suggest the possibility of leukemogenic and of genetic reproductive and neurological effects from chronic exposure a 2005 epidemiology review concluded in aggregate the human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in offspring of persons exposed to du the world health organization the directing and coordinating authority for health within developmental or carcinogenic effects have been reported in humans due to du exposure history enriched uranium was first manufactured in the early 1940s when the united states and britain began their nuclear weapons programs later in the decade france and the soviet union began their nuclear weapons and nuclear power programs it was at this time that depleted uranium was first stored as an unusable waste product uranium hexafluoride there was some hope that the enrichment process would be improved and fissionable isotopes of u 235 could at some future date be extracted from the depleted uranium this re enrichment recovery of the residual uranium 235 contained in the depleted uranium is no longer a matter of the future it has been practiced for several years also it is possible to design civilian power generating reactors using unenriched fuel but only about 10 cite print in the 1970s the pentagon reported that the soviet military had developed armor plating for warsaw pact tanks that nato ammunition could not penetrate the pentagon began searching for material to ordnance researchers settled on depleted uranium the us and nato militaries used du penetrator rounds in the 1991 gulf war the bosnia war while clearing a decades old hawaii firing range in 2005 workers found depleted uranium fins from training rounds from the formerly classified davy crockett recoilless gun tactical battlefield nuclear delivery system from the 1960s and 1970s these training rounds had been forgotten because they were used in a highly classified program and had been fired before du had become an item of interest more than 20 years before the gulf war production and availability natural uranium metal contains about 0 71 u 235 99 28 u 238 and about 0 0054 u 234 in order to produce enriched uranium the process of isotope separation removes a substantial portion of the u 235 for use in nuclear power weapons or other uses the remainder depleted uranium contains only 0 2 to 0 4 u 235 because natural uranium begins with such a low percentage of u 235 enrichment produces large quantities of depleted uranium for example kg of natural uranium and leaves about 10 8 kg of depleted uranium with only 0 3 u 235 remaining the nuclear regulatory commission nrc defines depleted uranium as uranium with a percentage of the sup 235 sup u isotope that is less than 0 711 by weight see the military specifications designate that the du used by the u s department of defense dod contain less than 0 3 sup 235 sup u aepi 1995 in actuality dod uses only du that contains approximately 0 2 sup 235 sup u aepi 1995 depleted uranium is also produced by recycling spent nuclear fuel in which case it contains traces of pu and np and has therefore been called dirty du although the quantities are so small that they are considered to be not of serious radiological significance even by ecrr uranium hexafluoride some depleted uranium produced is stored as uranium hexafluoride a crystalline solid d uf sub 6 sub in steel cylinders each cylinder holds up to 12 7 tonnes or 14 short tons of uf sub 6 sub in the u s 560 000 tonnes of depleted uf sub 6 sub had accumulated by 1993 in 2008 686 500 tonnes in 57 122 storage cylinders were located near portsmouth ohio and paducah kentucky the storage of duf sub 6 sub presents environmental health and safety risks because of its chemical instability when uf sub 6 sub is exposed to water vapor in the air it reacts with the moisture to produce uo sub 2 sub f sub 2 sub uranyl fluoride a solid and hf hydrogen fluoride a gas both of which are highly soluble and toxic the uranyl fluoride solid acts to plug the leak limiting further escape of depleted uf sub 6 sub release of the hydrogen fluoride gas to the atmosphere is also slowed by the plug formation storage cylinders are regularly inspected for signs of corrosion and leaks and are repainted and repaired as necessary a tenfold u s depleted uranium inventory into an asset worth 7 6 billion assuming doe re enriches the tails this estimate is based on february 2008 market price for uranium and enrichment services and doe s access to sufficient uranium enrichment capacity there have been several accidents involving uranium hexafluoride in the united states including one in which 32 workers were exposed to a cloud of uf sub 6 sub and its reaction products 1 person died and while a few workers with higher exposure experienced short term kidney damage e g protein in the urine none of them showed lasting damage from the exposure to uranium the u s government has been converting duf sub 6 sub to solid uranium oxides for use or disposal such disposal of the entire duf sub 6 sub inventory could cost anywhere from 15 million to 450 million world depleted uranium inventory small small military applications depleted uranium is very dense at 19 050 kg m it less dense than tungsten and gold and 84 as dense as osmium or iridium which are the densest known substances under standard i e earth surface pressures consequently a du projectile of given mass has a smaller diameter than an equivalent lead projectile with less aerodynamic drag and deeper penetration due to a higher pressure at point of impact du projectile ordnance is often inherently incendiary because of its pyrophoric property armor plate because of its high density depleted uranium can also be used in tank armor sandwiched between sheets of steel armor plate for instance some late production m1a1ha and m1a2 abrams tanks built after 1998 have du reinforcement as part of the armor plating in the front of the hull and the front of the turret and there is a program to upgrade the rest see chobham armor nuclear weapons depleted uranium is used as a tamper in fission bombs ammunition most military use of depleted uranium has been as 30 mm caliber ordnance primarily the 30 of the a 10 thunderbolt ii used by the united states air force 25 mm du rounds have been used in the m242 gun mounted on the u s army s bradley fighting vehicle and the marine corp s lav 25 the u s marine corps uses du in the 25 mm pgu 20 round fired by the gau 12 equalizer cannon of the av 8b harrier and also in the 20 mm m197 gun mounted on ah 1 cobra helicopter gunships the united states navy s phalanx ciws s m61 vulcan gatling gun used 20 mm armor piercing penetrator rounds with discarding plastic sabots made using depleted uranium later changed to tungsten another use of depleted uranium is in kinetic energy penetrators anti armor rounds such as the 120 mm sabot rounds fired from the british challenger 1 challenger 2 m1a1 and m1a2 abrams kinetic energy penetrator rounds consist of a long relatively thin penetrator surrounded by a discarding sabot staballoys are metal alloys of depleted uranium with a very small proportion of other metals usually titanium or molybdenum one formulation has a composition of 99 25 titanium staballoys are approximately 1 67 times as dense as lead and are designed for use in kinetic energy penetrator armor piercing ammunition the us army uses du in an alloy with around 3 5 titanium according to 2005 research at least some of the most promising tungsten alloys that have been considered as replacement for depleted uranium in penetrator ammunitions such as tungsten cobalt or tungsten nickel cobalt alloys also possess extreme carcinogenic properties which by far exceed those confirmed or suspected of depleted uranium itself 100 of rats implanted with a pellet of such alloys developed lethal rhabdomyosarcoma within a few weeks depleted uranium is favored for the penetrator because it is self sharpening and pyrophoric on impact with a hard target such as an armored vehicle the nose of the rod fractures in such a way that it remains sharp the impact and subsequent release of heat energy causes it to disintegrate to dust and burn when it reaches air because of its pyrophoric properties when a du penetrator reaches the interior of an armored vehicle it catches fire and possibly causing the vehicle to explode du is used by the u s army in 120 mm or 105 mm cannons employed on the m1 abrams tank the russian military has used du ammunition in tank main gun ammunition since the late 1970s mostly for the 115 mm guns in the t 62 tank and the 125 mm guns in the t 64 t 72 t 80 and t 90 tanks the du content in various ammunition is 180 g in 20 mm projectiles 200 g in 25 mm ones 280 g in 30 mm 3 5 kg in 105 mm and 4 5 kg in 120 mm penetrators du was used during the mid 1990s in the u s to make hand grenades cluster bombs and land mines but those applications have been discontinued according to alliant techsystems the us navy used du in its 20 mm phalanx ciws guns but switched in the late 1990s to armor piercing tungsten it is thought that between 17 and 20 countries have weapons incorporating depleted uranium in their arsenals they include the india turkey saudi arabia israel bahrain egypt kuwait pakistan thailand iraq and taiwan iran also has performed wide research on du penetrators since 2001 du ammunition is manufactured in 18 countries only the us and the uk have acknowledged using du weapons in a three week period of conflict in iraq during 2003 it was estimated that over 1000 tons of depleted uranium munitions were used legal status in weapons in 1996 the international court of justice icj gave an advisory opinion on the legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons this made it clear in paragraphs 54 55 and 56 that international law on poisonous weaponsthe second hague declaration of 29 july 1899 hague convention iv of 18 october 1907 and the geneva protocol of 17 june 1925did not cover nuclear weapons because their prime or exclusive use was not to poison or asphyxiate this icj opinion was about nuclear weapons but the sentence the terms have been ordinary sense as covering weapons whose prime or even exclusive effect is to poison or asphyxiate also removes depleted uranium weaponry from coverage by the same treaties as their primary use is not to poison or asphyxiate but to destroy materiel and kill soldiers through kinetic energy the sub commission on prevention of discrimination and protection of minorities of the united nations human rights commission passed two motions the first in 1996 and the second in 1997 they listed weapons of mass destruction or weapons with indiscriminate effect or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering and urged all states to curb the production and the spread of such weapons included in the list was weaponry containing depleted uranium the committee authorized a working paper in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms of the weapons the requested un working paper was delivered in 2002 by y k j yeung sik yuen in accordance with sub commission on the promotion and protection of human rights resolution 2001 36 he argues that the use of du the subcommission may breach one or more of the following treaties the universal declaration of human rights the charter of the united nations the genocide convention the united nations convention against torture the geneva conventions including protocol i the convention on conventional weapons of 1980 and the chemical weapons convention yeung sik yuen writes in paragraph 133 under the title legal compliance of weapons containing du as a new weapon louise arbour chief prosecutor for the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia led a committee of staff lawyers to investigate possible treaty prohibitions against the use of du in weapons their findings were that requests for a moratorium on military use some states and the international coalition to ban uranium weapons a coalition of more than 155 non governmental organizations have asked for a ban on the production and military use of depleted uranium weapons the european parliament has repeatedly passed resolutions requesting an immediate moratorium on the further use of depleted uranium ammunition but france and britain united nations security council have consistently rejected calls for a ban maintaining that its use continues to be legal and that the health risks are unsubstantiated in 2007 france britain the netherlands and the czech republic voted against a united nations general assembly resolution to hold a debate in 2009 about the effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium all other european union nations voted in favour or abstained the ambassador from the netherlands explained his negative vote as being due to the reference in the preamble to the resolution to potential harmful effects of the use of depleted uranium munitions on human health and the environment which can not in our view be supported by conclusive scientific studies conducted by relevant international organizations none of the other permanent members of the united nations security council supported the resolution as china was absent for the vote russia abstained and the united states voted against the resolution in september 2008 and in response to the 2007 general assembly resolution the un secretary general international atomic energy agency iaea and world health organization who the iaea and who evidence differed little from previous statements on the issue the report was largely split between states concerned about depleted uranium s use such as finland cuba japan serbia argentina and predominantly nato members who do not consider the use of depleted uranium munitions problematic in december 2008 141 states supported a resolution requesting that three un agencies united nations environment programme unep who and iaea update their research on the impact of uranium munitions by late 2010 to coincide with the general assembly s 65th session four voted against 34 abstained and 13 were absent as before britain and france voted against the resolution all other european union nations voted in favour or abstained the netherlands which voted against a resolution in 2007 voted in favour as did finland and norway both of which had abstained in 2007 while the czech republic which voted against the resolution in against the resolution were israel and the united states both of which voted against in 2007 while as before china was absent for the vote and russia abstained on june 21 2009 belgium became the first country in the world to ban inert ammunition and armour that contains depleted uranium or any other industrially manufactured uranium the move followed a unanimous parliamentary vote on the issue on 22 march 2007 the text of the 2007 law allowed for two years to pass until it came into force in april 2009 the belgian senate voted unanimously to restrict investments by belgian banks into the manufacturers of depleted uranium weapons in september 2009 the latin american parliament passed a resolution calling for a regional moratorium on the use production and procurement of uranium weapons it also called on the parlatino s members to work towards an international uranium weapons treaty in april 2011 the congress of costa rica passed a law prohibiting uranium weapons in its territories becoming the second country in the world to do bill seeking to outlaw depleted uranium weapons but it lapsed before approval by the dil civilian applications depleted uranium has a very high density and is primarily used as shielding material for other radioactive material and as ballast examples include sailboat keels as counterweights and as shielding in industrial radiography cameras shielding in industrial radiography cameras industrial radiography cameras include a very high activity gamma radiation source typically ir 192 with an activity above 10 tbq depleted uranium is often used in the cameras as a shield to protect individuals from the gamma source typically the uranium shield is supported and enclosed in polyurethane foam for thermal mechanical and oxidation protection and zeus detectors in due to its high density and natural radioactivity health considerations normal functioning of the kidney brain liver heart and numerous other systems can be affected by uranium exposure because in addition to being weakly radioactive uranium is a toxic metal if du particles do enter an individual the type of danger depend on the solubility of the particles briefly inhaled and insoluble means the du particles will stick around in the lungs and attendant lymph nodes presenting a radiological risk highly soluble means those particles are off to the kidneys where toxicity is the issue in military conflicts involving du munitions the major concern is inhalation of du particles in aerosols arising from the impacts of du enhanced projectiles with their targets when depleted uranium munitions penetrate armor or burn they create depleted uranium oxides in the form of dust that can be inhaled or contaminate wounds the institute of nuclear technology radiation protection of attiki greece has noted that the aerosol produced during impact and combustion of depleted uranium munitions can potentially contaminate wide areas around the impact sites or can be inhaled by civilians and military personnel the utilisation of du in incendiary ammunition is controversial because of potential adverse health effects and its release into the environment in early 2004 the uk pensions appeal tribunal service attributed birth defect claims from a february 1991 gulf a 2005 epidemiology review concluded in aggregate the human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in offspring of persons exposed to du studies using cultured cells and laboratory rodents continue to suggest the possibility of leukemogenic genetic reproductive and neurological effects from chronic exposure chemical toxicity the chemical toxicity of depleted uranium is about a million times greater in vitro than its radiological hazard with the kidney considered to be the main target organ health effects of du are determined by factors such as the extent of exposure and whether it was internal or external three main pathways exist by which internalization of uranium may occur inhalation ingestion and embedded fragments or shrapnel contamination properties such as phase e g particulate or gaseous oxidation state e g metallic or ceramic and the solubility of uranium and its compounds influence their absorption distribution translocation elimination and the resulting toxicity for example metallic uranium is less toxic compared to hexavalent of 2004 review information regarding uranium toxicity body system human studies animal studies in vitro uranium is pyrophoric when finely divided it will corrode under the influence of air and water producing insoluble uranium iv and soluble uranium vi salts soluble uranium salts are toxic uranium slowly accumulates in several organs such as the liver spleen and kidneys the world health organization has established a daily tolerated intake of soluble uranium salts for the general public of 0 5 g kg body weight or 35 g for a 70 kg adult epidemiological studies and toxicological tests on laboratory animals point to it as being immunotoxic and thus could not affect populations more than a few kilometers from target areas and that such particles if inhaled would remain undissolved in the lung for a great length of time and thus could be detected in urine violently burning uranium droplets produce a gaseous vapor comprising about half of the uranium in their original mass uranyl ion contamination in uranium oxides has approximately 90 micrograms of natural uranium on average exist in the human body as a result of normal intake of water food and air most is in the skeleton the biochemistry of depleted uranium is the same as natural uranium radiological hazards the primary radiation danger from pure depleted uranium is due to alpha particles which do not travel far through air and do not penetrate clothing however in a matter of a month or so a sample of pure depleted uranium will generate small amounts of thorium 234 and protactinium 234 which emit the more penetrating beta particles at almost the same rate as the uranium emits alpha rays this is because uranium 238 decays directly to thorium 234 which with a half life of 24 days decays to protactinium 234 which in turn decays in a matter of hours to the long lived uranium 234 a quasi steady state is therefore reached within a few multiples of 24 days available evidence suggests that the radiation risk is small relative to the chemical hazard surveying the veteran related evidence pertaining bmj concluded it was not possible to justify claims of radiation induced lung cancer and leukaemia in veterans of that conflict while agreeing with the editorial s conclusion a reply noted that its finding in the negative was guaranteed given that global dose estimates or results of mathematical modelling are too inaccurate to be used as dose values for an individual veteran and that as of april 2001 no practical method of measuring the expected small doses that each individual veteran would receive had been suggested mould s suggestion was electron paramagnetic resonance dosimetry using tooth enamel he also wrote that the us national institute of standards and technology was able using this method to measure doses as low as 20 msv and that if it were asked to the nist would be able to get involved meaning at least one centre could help undertake a screening programme for veterans the author of the reply a radiation scientist went on to suggest a method that had been used several times the widespread use of du in the iraq war at least a year after the conflict began testing for uk troops was still only in the discussion phase which found that perhaps a quarter of all uk troops would have been interested in undergoing du related monitoring although the desire for du screening is more closely linked to current health status rather than plausible exposure to du p confusingly reports that testing is now available to all troops that served in iraq and does not say if this is testing la mould the royal society du working group concluded in 2002 that there were very low health risks associated with the use of depleted uranium though also ventured that in extreme conditions and under worst case assumptions lung and kidney damage could occur and that in worst case scenarios high local levels of uranium could occur in food or water that could have adverse effects on the kidney in 2003 the royal society issued another urgent call to investigate the actual health and environmental impact of depleted uranium the found no elevated risks of cancer generally nor of any specific cancers in particular though recommended follow up studies according to the world health organization a radiation dose from it would be about 60 of that from purified natural uranium with the same mass the radiological dangers are lower due to its longer half life and the removal of the more radioactive isotopes gulf war syndrome and soldier complaints since 1991 the year the gulf war ended veterans and their families voiced concern about subsequent health problems in 1999 assessment of the first 1 000 veterans involved in the ministry of defence s gulf war medical assessment programme found no evidence of a single illness physical or mental that would explain the pattern of symptoms observed in the group nevertheless in 1999 medact petitioned for the who to conduct an investigation into illnesses in veterans and iraqi civilians a major 2006 review of peer reviewed literature by a us institute of medicine committee concluded that because the symptoms vary greatly among individuals they do not though their report conceded that the lack of objective pre deployment health data meant definitive conclusions were effectively impossible the quote is of lynn goldman who chaired the iom committee that carried out the review p notes that despite clear evidence of an increase in symptom burden and a decrease in well being among gulf war veterans exhaustive clinical and laboratory based scientific research has failed to document many reproducible biomedical abnormalities in this group likewise there has been no evidence of an increase in disease related mortality simon wessely praised the iom s review and noted that despite its central conclusion that no novel syndrome existed its other findings made it equally clear that service in the gulf war did aversely affect health in some personnel the quote is of wessely himself aside from the lack of baseline data to guide analysis of the veterans postwar health because no detailed health screening was carried out when the veterans entered service another major stumbling block with some studies like the thousand veteran one is that making general conclusions impossible increased rates of immune system disorders and other wide ranging symptoms including chronic pain fatigue and memory loss have been reported in over one quarter of combat veterans of the 1991 gulf war combustion products from depleted uranium munitions are being considered as one of the potential causes by the research advisory committee on gulf war veterans illnesses as du was used in 30 mm and 25 mm cannon rounds on a large scale for the first time in the gulf war veterans of the conflicts in the persian gulf bosnia and kosovo have been found to have up to 14 times the usual level of chromosome abnormalities in their genes serum soluble genotoxic teratogens produce congenital disorders and in white blood cells causes immune system damage human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in the offspring of persons exposed to du after examination of children s medical records two years later the birth defect rate increased by more than 20 in early 2004 the uk pensions appeal gulf war combat veteran to depleted uranium poisoning looking at the risk of children of uk gulf war veterans suffering genetic diseases such as congenital malformations commonly called birth defects one study found that the overall risk of any malformation was 50 higher in gulf war veterans as compared to other veterans the u s army has commissioned ongoing research into potential risks of depleted uranium and other projectile weapon materials like tungsten which the u s navy has used in place of du since 1993 studies by the u s armed forces radiobiology research institute conclude that moderate exposures to either depleted uranium or uranium present a significant toxicological threat in 2003 professor brian spratt frs chairman of the royal society s working group on depleted uranium said the question of who carries out the initial monitoring and clean up is a political rather than scientific question and the coalition needs to acknowledge that depleted uranium is a potential hazard and make in roads into tackling it by being open about where and how much depleted uranium has been deployed a 2008 review medline through to the end of 2007 including multiple cohort studies of veterans found no consistent evidence of excess risks of neoplasms that could have some link to du and that the overall incidence of cancers is not increased in the cohort studies of gulf war and balkans veterans though a more comprehensive assessment is possible a 2011 update on a cancer scare regarding italian soldiers who had served in the balkans found lower than expected incidence rates for all cancers a finding consistent with lacking evidence of an increased cancer incidence among troops of other countries deployed in the areas of iraq bosnia and kosovo where armour penetrating depleted uranium shells have been used one particular subgroup of veterans that may be at higher risk comprises those who have internally retained fragments of du from shrapnel wounds a laboratory study on rats produced by the armed forces radiobiology research institute showed that after a study period of 6 months rats treated with depleted uranium coming from implanted pellets comparable to the average levels in the urine of a significant tendency to lose weight with respect to the control group substantial amounts of uranium were accumulating in their brains and central nervous systems and showed a significant reduction of neuronal activity in the hippocampus in response to external stimuli the conclusions of the study show that brain damage from chronic uranium intoxication is possible at lower doses than previously thought results from computer based neurocognitive tests performed in 1997 showed an association between uranium in the urine and problematic performance on automated tests assessing performance efficiency and accuracy iraqi population since 2001 medical personnel at the basra hospital in southern iraq have reported a sharp increase in the incidence of child leukemia and genetic malformation among babies born in the decade following the gulf war iraqi doctors attributed these malformations to possible long term effects of du an opinion that was echoed by several newspapers in 2004 iraq had the highest mortality rate due to leukemia of any country in 2003 the royal society called for western militaries to disclose where and how much du they had studies could be undertaken out in affected areas the international coalition to ban uranium weapons icbuw likewise urged that an epidemiological study be made in the basra region as asked for by iraqi doctors but no peer reviewed study has yet been undertaken in basra a medical survey cancer infant mortality and birth sex ratio in fallujah iraq 20052009 published in july 2010 states that the increases in cancer and birth defectsare alarmingly high and that infant mortality 2009 2010 has reached 13 6 the group compares the dramatic increase five years after the actual war 2004 or exposure with the lymphoma italian peacekeepers developed after the balkan wars and the increased cancer risk in certain parts of sweden due to the chernobyl fallout the origin and time of introduction of the carcinogenic agent causing the genetic stress the group will address in a separate report the report mentions depleted uranium as one potentially relevant exposure but makes no conclusions on the source four studies in the second half of 2012one of which described genetic damage in any population ever studied renewed calls for the us and uk to investigate the possible links between their military assault on the city in 2004 and the explosion in deformities cancers and other serious health problems even though no depleted uranium was found in soil samples taken from fallujah the balkans in 2001 the world health organization reported that data from kosovo was inconclusive and called for further studies a 2003 study by the united nations environment programme unep in bosnia and herzegovina stated that low levels of contaminate were found in drinking water and air particulate at du penetrator impact points the levels were stated as not a cause for alarm yet pekka haavisto chairman of the unep du projects stated the findings of this study stress again the importance of appropriate clean up and civil protection measures in a post conflict situation a team of italian scientists from the university of siena reported in 2005 that although du was clearly added to the soil in the study area the phenomenon was very natural range of the element in soils moreover the absolute uranium concentrations indicate that there was no contamination of the earthworm species studied contamination as a result of the afghan war the canadian uranium medical research centre obtained urine samples from bombed civilian areas in jalalabad that showed concentrations of 80400 ng l of undepleted uranium far higher than the typical concentration in the british population of 5 ng l studies indicating negligible effects studies in 2005 and earlier have concluded that du ammunition has no measurable detrimental health effects a 1999 literature review conducted by the rand corporation stated no evidence is documented in the literature of cancer or any other negative health effect related to the radiation received from exposure to depleted or natural uranium whether inhaled or ingested even at very high doses and a rand report authored by the u s defense department undersecretary charged with evaluating du hazards considered the debate to be more political than scientific a 2001 oncology study concluded that the present scientific consensus is that du exposure to humans in to give rise to cancer induction former nato secretary general lord robertson stated in 2001 that the existing medical consensus is clear the hazard from depleted uranium is both very limited and limited to very specific circumstances a 2002 study from the australian defense ministry concluded that there has been no established increase in mortality or morbidity in workers exposed to uranium in uranium processing industries studies of gulf war veterans show that in those who have retained fragments of depleted uranium following combat related injury it has been possible to detect elevated urinary uranium levels but no kidney toxicity or other adverse health effects related to depleted uranium after a decade of follow up pier roberto danesi then director of the international atomic energy agency iaea seibersdorf laboratory stated in 2002 that there is a consensus now that du does not represent a health threat a 2005 study by sandia national laboratories al marshall used mathematical models to analyze potential health effects associated with accidental exposure to depleted uranium during the 1991 gulf war marshall s exposure are not supported by his analysis nor by veteran medical statistics marshall also examined possible genetic effects due to radiation from depleted uranium chemical effects including potential reproductive issues associated with depleted uranium exposure were discussed in some detail in a subsequent journal paper atmospheric contamination as a result of military actions elevated radiation levels consistent with very low level atmospheric depleted uranium contamination have been found in air samples taken by the uk atomic weapons establishment at several monitoring sites in britain these elevated readings appear to coincide with operation anaconda in afghanistan and the shock and awe bombing campaign at the start of the second gulf war other contamination cases on october 4 1992 an el al boeing 747 f cargo aircraft flight 1862 crashed into an apartment building in amsterdam local residents and rescue workers complained of various unexplained health issues which were being attributed to the release of hazardous materials during the crash and subsequent fires authorities conducted an epidemiological study in 2000 of those

public switched telephone network and conceived an end to end circuit switched services known as broadband integrated services digital network b isdn before b isdn the original isdn attempted to substitute the analog telephone system with a digital system which was appropriate for both voice and non voice traffic obtaining worldwide agreement on the basic rate interface standard was expected to lead to a large user demand for isdn equipment hence leading to mass production and inexpensive isdn chips however the standardization process took years while computer network technology moved rapidly once the isdn standard was finally agreed upon and products were available it was already obsolete for home use the largest demand for new services was video and voice transfer but the isdn basic rate lacks the necessary channel capacity for business isdn s 64 kbit s data rate compared unfavorably to 10 mbit s local area networks such as ethernet this led to introduction the term had a

election held from friday november 1 to wednesday december 4 1844 democrat james k polk defeated whig henry clay in a close contest that turned on the controversial issue of slavery expansion through the annexation of the republic of texas the general election of 1844 took place in the midst of increasingly bitter congressional disputes over anti slavery agitation raising questions as to whether free soil and slave soil interests could coexist within a democratic republic the campaign themes arose in direct response to incumbent president john tyler s pursuit of texas annexation as a slave state so as to undermine the unity of the whig and democratic parties in his bid to retain the white house the whig party nominee henry clay adopted an anti annexation platform on the principle of preserving north south sectional unity and to avoid war by respecting mexico s claims to texas clay s attempts to finesse his anti annexation position on texas alienated many voters in the south and west where annexation support was to the anti slavery liberty party democrat martin van buren his party s presumptive presidential contender was ousted at the democratic national convention failing to meet the demands of southern democrat expansionists for a leader favoring the immediate acquisition of texas democrat james k polk emerged as america s first dark horse nominee running on a platform that embraced america s popular commitment to territorial expansionism referred to as manifest destiny polk successfully linked the us british boundary dispute over the partition of oregon territory with the divisive texas annexation debate in doing so the democratic party nominee united the anti slavery northern expansionists who demanded oregon as free soil with pro slavery southern expansionists who insisted on acquiring texas as a slave state in doing so polk narrowly outpolled the whig party nominee clay by thirty eight thousand votes party alliances were shaken by the texas controversy but partisan loyalties among congressional democrats were rallied sufficiently in the aftermath of polk s victory to pass a joint house senate resolution on texas annexation texas would enter the union as presidential election to be held on different days in different states starting with the presidential election of 1848 all states held the election on the same date in november it is also the only presidential election in which the winner polk lost both his birth state of north carolina and his state of residence tennessee background gag rule and texas annexation controversies whigs and democrats embarked upon their campaigns during the climax of the congressional gag rule controversies in 1844 during which southern congressmen had suppressed northern petitions to end the slave trade in the district of columbia anti annexation petitions to congress sent from northern anti slavery forces including state legislatures had been similarly suppressed intraparty sectional compromises and maneuvering on slavery politics during these divisive debates had placed significant strain on the northern and southern wings that comprised each political organization the question as to whether the institution of slavery and its aristocratic principles of social authority were compatible with democratic republicanism was becoming a permanent issue in national politics in 1836 a declared its independence to form the republic of texas texans mostly white immigrants from the deep south many of whom owned slaves sought to bring their republic into the union as a state during the eight years since the texas republic had declared its independence from mexico the subject of annexing texas to the united states was shunned by both major american political parties though recognizing texas sovereignty presidents andrew jackson 1829 1837 and martin van buren 1837 1841 would decline to pursue annexation the prospect of bringing another slave state into the union was fraught with problems both major parties the democrats and whigs viewed texas statehood as not worth a foreign war with mexico or the sectional combat that annexation would provoke in the united states tyler texas treaty the incumbent us president john tyler of virginia formerly vice president had ascended to the white house upon the death of william henry harrison in 1841 tyler a whig in name only emerged as a states rights advocate committed vetoing the whig domestic legislative agenda he was expelled from his own party on september 13 1841 politically isolated but unencumbered by party restraints tyler aligned himself with a small faction of texas annexationists in a bid for reelection in 1844 tyler became convinced that great britain had encouraged a texas mexico rapprochement that might lead to slave emancipation in the texas republic accordingly he directed secretary of state abel p upshur of virginia to initiate then relentlessly pursued secret annexation talks with texas minister to the united states isaac van zandt beginning on october 16 1843 tyler submitted his texas us treaty for annexation to the us senate delivered april 22 1844 where a two thirds majority was required for ratification the newly appointed secretary of state john c calhoun of south carolina assuming his post march 29 1844 included a document known as the packenham letter with the tyler bill that was calculated to inject a sense of crisis in southern democrats of the deep south in it he characterized as an emergency measure necessary to safeguard the peculiar institution in the united states in doing so tyler and calhoun sought to unite the south in a crusade that would present the north with an ultimatum support texas annexation or lose the south anti slavery whigs considered texas annexation particularly egregious since mexico had outlawed slavery in coahuila y tejas in 1829 before texas independence had been declared historian william lee miller points out that the significance of acquiring texas annexing it now became quite different after the mexican government abolished slavery in 1829 after which the expansionist impulse included an overt reference to slavery the 1844 presidential campaigns evolved within the context of this struggle over texas annexation explicitly tied to the question of slavery expansion and national security all candidates in 1844 presidential election had to declare a position on this explosive issue nominations whig party convention and campaign whig candidates senator henry clay of kentucky effectively the leader of the whig party since its inception in 1834 was selected as the maryland on may 1 1844 clay a slaveholder presided over a party in which its southern wing was sufficiently committed to the national platform to put partisan loyalties above slavery expansionist proposals that might undermine its north south alliance whigs felt confident that clay could duplicate harrison s landslide victory of 1840 against any opposition candidate southern whigs feared that with the acquisition of texas fertile lands would produce a huge market for slave labor inflating the price of slaves and deflating land values in their home states northern whigs feared that texas statehood would initiate the opening of a vast empire for slavery two weeks before the whig convention in baltimore in reaction to calhoun s packenham letter clay issued a document known as the raleigh letter issued april 17 1844 presenting his views on texas to his fellow southern whigs in it he flatly denounced the tyler annexation bill and predicted that its passage would provoke a war with mexico whose government had never recognized texas independence clay underlined he would block annexation in the event that substantial sectional opposition existed anywhere in the united states the whig party leadership was acutely aware that any proslavery legislation advanced by its southern wing would alienate its anti slavery northern wing and cripple the party in the general election in order to preserve their party whigs would need to stand squarely against acquiring a new slave state as such whigs were content to restrict their 1844 campaign platform to less divisive issues such as internal improvements and national finance whigs picked theodore frelinghuysen of new jersey the christian statesman as clay s running mate an advocate of colonization of emancipated slaves he was acceptable to southern whigs as an opponent of the abolitionists his pious reputation balanced clay s image as a slave holding hard drinking duelist their party slogan was the bland hurray hurray the country s risin vote for clay and frelinghuysen henry clay s alabama letter on july 27 1844 henry clay in the midst of his campaign against james k letter in it he counseled his whig constituency to regard texas annexation and statehood as merely a short phase in the decline of slavery in the united states rather than a long term advance for the slavepower clay qualified his stance on texas annexation declaring no personal objection to the annexation of the republic he would move back to his original orientation in september 1844 northern whigs expressed outrage at any dtente with the slavepower failing to evince single mindedness they accused him of eqivocating on texas annexation clay s central position however had not altered no annexation without northern acquiescence clay s commitment brought southern whigs under extreme pressure in their home states and congressional districts threatening to tarnish their loyalty to slavery credentials whig party campaign tactics historian sean wilentz describes some the whig campaign tactics the liberty party added to the confusion clay became the object of nasty abolitionist attacks one notorious handbill widely reprinted by an abolitionist minister abel j brown democratic party campaign and chief architect of the jacksonian democracy was presumptive democratic presidential contender in the spring of 1844 with calhoun withdrawing his bid for the presidency in january 1844 the campaign was expected to focus on domestic issues all this changed with the tyler treaty van buren regarded the tyler annexation measure as an attempt to sabotage his bid for the white house by exacerbating the already strained democratic north south alliance regarding slavery expansion calhoun s packenham letter would serve to spur democrats of the south to the task of forcing the northern wing of the party to submit to texas annexation despite the high risk of aggressively injecting slavery into their political campaign over texas van buren s hammet letter van buren realized that accommodating slavery expansionists in the south would open the northern democrats to withering charges of appeasement to the slavepower from the strongly anti annexation northern whigs and some democrats he crafted an emphatically anti texas position that temporized with expansionist southern democrats laying out a highly conditional scenario that delayed texas annexation indefinitely penned april 20 he counseled his party to reject texas under a tyler administration furthermore annexation of texas as a territory would proceed tentatively under a van buren administration only when the american public had been consulted on the matter and mexico s cooperation had been pursued to avoid an unnecessary war a military option might be advanced if a groundswell of popular support arose for texas certified with a congressional mandate in these respects martin van buren differed from henry clay who would never tolerate annexation without mexico s assent with the publication of clay s raleigh letter and van buren s hammett letter van burenite democrats hoped that their candidate s posture on texas would leave southern pro annexationists with exactly one choice for us president martin van buren in this they misapprehended the political situation tyler and the southern pro annexationists posed a potentially far greater threat then clay in that the tyler calhoun treaty would put immense pressure on the northern democrats to comply with southern democrats demands for texas deep south extremists who had responded favorably to calhoun s pakenham letter a minority phlanx of the southern democrat leadership remained obdurate that northern democratic legislators would when exposed to sufficient southern pressure ignore their constituents opposition to slavery expansion and unite in support of texas annexation the extent to which southern democrat support for martin van buren had eroded over texas annexation crisis became evident when van buren s southern counterpart in the rise of the democratic party thomas ritchie of the richmond enquirer terminated their 20 year political alliance in favor of immediate annexation andrew jackson secretary of state john c calhoun a political outsider like john tyler gained significant credibility when his former nemesis ex president andrew jackson 1829 1837 publicly announced his support for immediate texas annexation in may 1844 old hickory had facilitated tyler s texas negotiations in february 1844 by reassuring president of the texas republic sam houston that the us senate ratification of the tyler treaty was likely as the senate debated the tyler treaty jackson be respected and any delay would result in a british balkanized texas republic promoting slave emancipation and posing a foreign military threat to the southwest united states the former military hero went further urging all jacksonian democrats to block martin van buren from the party ticket and seek a democratic presidential candidate fully committed to the immediate annexation of texas in doing so jackson abandoned the jeffersonian jacksonian formula that had characterized his party since the 1820s which had required its northern and southern wings to compromise on constitutional slavery disputes texas was fracturing van buren s support among democrats and would derail his bid for president of the united states democratic party convention democratic candidates 20 9576 gallery 29 9598 toolong governor

for nomination the rule would remain in place until it was revoked by franklin delano roosevelt in 1936 following a historical pattern in which a minority faction of northern democrats delivered votes to produce southern wing victories for pro slavery legislation the van burenite delegates split over the pivotal vote fully one third of the pro van buren delegates 52 of 154 voted to reinstate the two thirds rule along with 90 of 104 anti van buren delegates producing a final vote of 148 to 116 van buren supporters persisted in spite of this setback garnering 146 votes for their candidate on the first ballot a 55 simple majority but short of the now required 177 votes middle and deep south pro annexationists opposed van buren 75 for victory support for van buren dwindled in subsequent ballots from 146 to 99 at which point van burenites were reduced to blocking nominations of numerous candidates among them james buchanan lewis cass of michigan john c calhoun and levi woodbury of new hampshire southern intransigence had succeeded in eliminating van buren and his principled stand on texas annexation if the democratic party was to avoid dissolution at a national level an acceptable nominee fully committed to immediate annexation would be required yet capable of unifying the party in the general election james k polk dark horse southern democrats benefited from the tyler calhoun machinations in eliminating martin van buren as a presidential candidate and clearing the way for the pro annexation nationalist polk on the eighth ballot polk was offered to the convention as an acceptable alternative for all democratic factions at odds over the texas annexation crisis despite polk s fervent advocacy for annexation he had remained loyal to van buren throughout the texas controversy and anti annexationist van burenites were willing him as a suitable vice presidential choice to have complimented a van buren ticket despite whig efforts to cast polk as an unknown who is james k polk they asked rhetorically he was respected as an effective political operator his sobriquet the young hickory contained a dual reference one to his mentor andrew old hickory jackson and one to the term young america a reference to an international movements struggling to establish republican forms of government and the overthrow of monarchies and ascribed to manifest destiny democrats james k polk a slaveholder never enunciated a slavery expansionist position with respect to texas annexation as had john c calhoun and the southern extremists as a national imperialist he exhibited an unwavering support for manifest destiny perceived as a non sectional devotion to expansionism whether slave soil texas or free soil oregon territory polk s political reputation was expected to diffuse northern democratic resentment towards the slavepower while delivering texas to the deep south on may 29 1844 polk was confirmed unanimously on the ninth ballot as the democratic s decision to unite under a pro annexation candidate and worked to win new york state for polk the anti annexationist silas wright us senator from new york was offered the nomination for polk s vice presidential running mate wright declined on principle and the convention settled on george m dallas a conservative from pennsylvania democratic party campaign tactics historian sean wilentz describes some the democrat campaign tactics senate vote on the tyler texas treaty the tyler texas annexation treaty submitted to the senate in april 1844 was defeated in the whig controlled senate largely along partisan lines 16 to 35 a two thirds majority against passage on june 8 1844 whigs voted 27 1 against the treaty all northern whig senators voted nay and fourteen of fifteen southern whig senators had joined them democrats voted for the treaty 15 8 with a slight majority of northern democrats opposing southern democrats affirmed the treaty 10 1 with only one slave state senator thomas hart benton voting against three days later tyler the supermajority requirement for senate treaty approval substituting the constitutional protocols for admitting regions of the united states into the union as states tyler proposed that alternative yet constitutional means be used to bring the republic of texas a foreign country into the union tyler and calhoun formerly staunch supporters of minority safeguards based on the supermajority requirements for national legislation now altered their position to facilitate passage of the tyler treaty tyler s attempt to evade the senate vote launched a spirited congressional debate national democratic republican party campaign and convention tyler and texas when the senate closed session debates on the tyler texas treaty were leaked to the public on april 27 1844 tyler s only hope of success in influencing passage of the his treaty was to intervene directly as candidate in the 1844 election as kingmaker his democratic republican party a recycling of thomas jefferson s party name held its convention on may 27 1844 in baltimore maryland a short distance from the unfolding democratic party convention that would the same day without challenge accepting the honor on may 30 1844 he designated no vice president as running mate democratic party nominee james k polk was faced with the possibility that a tyler ticket might shift votes away from the democrats and provide whig henry clay with the margin of victory in a close race tyler made clear in his convention acceptance speech that his overriding concern was the ratification of his texas annexation treaty moreover he hinted that he would drop out of the race when that end was assured informing polk through senator robert j walker that his campaign efforts were simply a vehicle to mobilize support for texas annexation tyler concentrated his resources in the states of new york pennsylvania and new jersey all highly contested states in the election securing enough democratic support his withdrawal might prove indispensable to polk polk was receptive as long as tyler could withdraw without raising suspicion of a secret bargain to solidify tyler s cooperation polk enlisted andrew jackson to reassure tyler that on august 20 1844 tyler dropped out of the presidential race tylerites moved quickly to support the democratic party nominee other nominations james birney ran as the anti slavery liberty party candidate garnering 2 3 of the popular vote and over 8 of the vote in massachusetts new hampshire and vermont the votes he won were more than the difference in votes between henry clay and james k polk some scholars have argued that birney s support among anti slavery whigs in new york swung that decisive state in favor of polk see below joseph smith jr mayor of nauvoo illinois and founder of the latter day saint movement ran as an independent he proposed the redemption of slaves by selling public lands and decreasing the size and salary of the united states

carthage il jail on june 27 1844 election results polk s adoption of manifest destiny paid dividends at the polls no longer identified with the tyler calhoun southern crusade for slavery the western democrats could embrace texas annexation the democrats enjoyed a huge upsurge in voter turnout up to 20 over the figures from 1840 especially in the northwest and mid atlantic regions the whigs showed only a 4 increase the democrats won michigan illinois and indiana and nearly took ohio where manifest destiny was strongest in the deep south clay lost every state to polk a huge reversal from the 1840 race but carried most of the middle and border south clay s waffling on texas may have cost him the 41 electoral votes in both new york and michigan here the former slaveholder now abolitionist james g birney of the liberty party received 15 812 and 3 632 respectively on the basis of his unwavering stand against texas annexation polk won by a mere 5 106 3 422 out of 52 096 votes in michigan had either of these voting blocks cast their ballots for the anti annexationist clay he would have defeated polk despite this clay s opposition to annexation and western slavery expansion served him

texas was formalized on march 1 1845 before polk even took office as feared mexico refused to accept the annexation and the mexican american war broke out in 1846 with polk s main issue of texas

the headquarters of the people the town was founded by molema tawana c 1822 january 1882 born in khunwana during the difaqane period molema was the son of kgosi close confidant montshiwa later became chief during the period that the tshidi barolong resided at thaba nchu where they found refuge during the difaqane molema was converted to christianity by the wesleyan missionaries based there molema s son and heir silas molema was educated at healdtown college silas helped his nephew sebopioa molema get to the united states about 1904 to study law at wilberforce university in wilberforce ohio in 1857 molema led an advance guard to scout out the area along the molopo river this was a familiar area as they had previously lived in nearby khunwana molema settled at mafikeng known in its early years as molemas town while the main body of the barolong under montshiwa followed but montshiwa did not feel safe at mafikeng due to the close presence and encroachment of the boers in the transvaal he led his followers to moshaneng in the territory of the bangwaketse in present day botswana molema remained at mafikeng to ensure that the barolong retained a presence there sites in the proximity of the molopo molema had to use all his diplomatic skills on several occasions to prevent boer incursion and settlement near mafikeng he has been described as a man of strong personality and exceptional gifts and montshiwa s chief counsellor in vital matters s m molema 35 after negotiations with molema montshiwa decided to return to mafikeng in 1876 molema was a firm believer in western education having attended healdtown he opened a school for the barolong once they had settled in the district molema became a farmer and businessman as well as advising his brother montshiwa he died in 1882 one of his sons silas molema became a doctor and historian of the barolong see s m molema the settlement was named mafikeng a setswana name meaning place of stones later british settlers spelled the name as mafeking the jameson raid started from pitsani pothlugo or potlogo 24 mi north of mafeking on december 29 1895 at the outbreak was besieged the siege of mafeking lasted 217 days from october 1899 to may 1900 and turned robert baden powell into a national hero in september 1904 lord roberts unveiled an obelisk at mafeking bearing the names of those who fell in defence of the town in all 212 people were killed during the siege with more than 600 wounded boer losses were significantly higher although it was outside the protectorate s borders mafeking served as capital of the bechuanaland protectorate from 1894 until 1965 when gaborone was made the capital of what was to become botswana mafeking also briefly served as capital of the pre independence bantustan of bophuthatswana in the 1970s before the adjoining town of mmabatho was established as capital following a local referendum on the issue mafeking joined bophuthatswana in 1980 three years after bophuthatswana was awarded independence and was renamed mafikeng and treated as a suburb of mmabatho following the end of apartheid in 1994 the merged mafikeng and mmabatho was instated as capital

reflects more solar radiation or less radiation is transmitted cloud albedo varies from less than 10 to more than 90 and depends on drop sizes liquid water or ice content thickness of the cloud and the sun s zenith angle the smaller the drops and the greater the liquid water content the greater the cloud albedo if all other factors are the same low thick clouds such as stratocumulus primarily reflect incoming solar radiation causing it to have a high albedo whereas high thin clouds such as cirrus tend to transmit it to the surface but then trap outgoing infrared radiation causing it to have low albedo it contributes to the greenhouse effect birthplace beauvais oise france deathplace paris henri lon lebesgue formemrs june 28 1875 july 26 1941 was a french mathematician most famous for his theory of integration which was a generalization of the 17th century concept of integrationsumming the area between an axis and the curve of a function defined for that axis his theory was published originally in his dissertation intgrale longueur aire integral length area at the university of nancy during 1902 personal life henri lebesgue was born on 28 june 1875 in beauvais oise lebesgue s father was a typesetter and his mother was a school teacher his parents assembled at home a library that the young henri was able to use unfortunately his father died of tuberculosis when lebesgue was still very young and his mother had to support him by herself as he showed a remarkable talent for mathematics in primary school one of his instructors arranged for community support to continue his education and lyce louis le grand in paris in 1894 lebesgue was accepted at the cole normale suprieure where he continued to focus his energy on the study of mathematics graduating in 1897 after graduation he remained at the cole normale suprieure for two years working in the library where he became aware of the research on discontinuity done at that time by ren louis baire a recent graduate of the school at the same time he started his graduate studies at the sorbonne where he learned about mile borel s work on the incipient measure theory and camille jordan s work on the jordan measure in 1899 he moved to a teaching position at the lyce central in nancy while continuing work on his doctorate in 1902 he earned his ph d from the sorbonne with the seminal thesis on integral length area submitted with borel four years older as advisor lebesgue married the sister of one of his fellow students and he and his wife had two children suzanne and jacques after position at the university of rennes lecturing there until 1906 when he moved to the faculty of sciences of the university of poitiers in 1910 lebesgue moved to the sorbonne as a matre de confrences being promoted to professor starting with 1919 in 1921 he left the sorbonne to become professor of mathematics at the collge de france where he lectured and did research for the rest of his life in 1922 he was elected a member of the acadmie franaise henri lebesgue died on 26 july 1941 in paris mathematical career lebesgue s first paper was published in 1898 and was titled sur l approximation des fonctions it dealt with weierstrass theorem on approximation to continuous functions by polynomials between march 1899 and april 1901 lebesgue published six notes in comptes rendus the first of these unrelated to his development of lebesgue integration dealt with the extension of baire s theorem to functions of two variables the next five dealt with surfaces applicable to a plane the area a given bound and the final note gave the definition of lebesgue integration for some function f x lebesgue s great thesis intgrale longueur aire with the full account of this work appeared in the annali di matematica in 1902 the first chapter develops the theory of measure see borel measure in the second chapter he defines the integral both geometrically and analytically the next chapters expand the comptes rendus notes dealing with length area and applicable surfaces the final chapter deals mainly with plateau s problem this dissertation is considered to be one of the finest ever written by a mathematician his lectures from 1902 to 1903 were collected into a borel tract leons sur l intgration et la recherche des fonctions primitives the problem of integration regarded as the search for a primitive function is the keynote of the book lebesgue presents the problem of integration in its historical context addressing augustin louis cauchy peter gustav lejeune dirichlet and desirable that the integral should satisfy the last of which is if the sequence f sub n sub x increases to the limit f x the integral of f sub n sub x tends to the integral of f x lebesgue shows that his conditions lead to the theory of measure and measurable functions and the analytical and geometrical definitions of the integral he turned next to trigonometric functions with his 1903 paper sur les sries trigonomtriques he presented three major theorems in this work that a trigonometrical series representing a bounded function is a fourier series that the n sup th sup fourier coefficient tends to zero the riemannlebesgue lemma and that a fourier series is integrable term by term in 1904 1905 lebesgue lectured once again at the collge de france this time on trigonometrical series and he went on to publish his lectures in another of the borel tracts in this tract he once again treats the subject in its historical context he expounds on fourier series cantor riemann theory the poisson reprsentation trigonomtrique approche des fonctions satisfaisant a une condition de lipschitz deals with the fourier series of functions satisfying a lipschitz condition with an evaluation of the order of magnitude of the remainder term he also proves that the riemannlebesgue lemma is a best possible result for continuous functions and gives some treatment to lebesgue constants lebesgue once wrote rduites des thories gnrales les mathmatiques seraient une belle forme sans contenu reduced to general theories mathematics would be a beautiful form without content in measure theoretic analysis and related branches of mathematics the lebesguestieltjes integral generalizes riemannstieltjes and lebesgue integration preserving the many advantages of the latter in a more general measure theoretic framework during the course of his career lebesgue also made forays into the realms of complex analysis and topology he also had a disagreement with borel called teilweise heftig with regards to effective calculation however these minor forays pale in comparison to his contributions to real analysis his contributions to this field had a his methods have become an essential part of modern analysis additionally he is claimed to be the last of the mathematicians to consider one to be a prime number lebesgue s theory of integration this is a non technical treatment from a historical point of view see the article lebesgue integration for a technical treatment from a mathematical point of view integration is a mathematical operation that corresponds to the informal idea of finding the area under the graph of a function the first theory of integration was developed by archimedes in the 3rd century bc with his method of quadratures but this could be applied only in limited circumstances with a high degree of geometric symmetry in the 17th century isaac newton and gottfried wilhelm leibniz discovered the idea that integration was intrinsically linked to differentiation the latter being a way of measuring how quickly a function changed at any given point on the graph this surprising relationship between two major geometric operations in calculus differentiation and integration is now known as to calculate a broad class of integrals for the first time however unlike archimedes method which was based on euclidean geometry mathematicians felt that newton s and leibniz s integral calculus did not have a rigorous foundation in the 19th century augustin cauchy developed epsilon delta limits and bernhard riemann followed up on this by formalizing what is now called the riemann integral to define this integral one fills the area under the graph with smaller and smaller rectangles and takes the limit of the sums of the areas of the rectangles at each stage for some functions however the total area of these rectangles does not approach a single number as such they have no riemann integral lebesgue invented a new method of integration to solve this problem instead of using the areas of rectangles which put the focus on the domain of the function lebesgue looked at the codomain of the function for his fundamental unit of area lebesgue s idea was to first define measure for both sets build the integral for what he called simple functions measurable functions that take only finitely many values then he defined it for more complicated functions as the least upper bound of all the integrals of simple functions smaller than the function in question lebesgue integration has the property that every function defined over a bounded interval with a riemann integral also has a lebesgue integral and for those functions the two integrals agree furthermore every bounded function on a closed bounded interval has a lebesgue integral and there are many functions with a lebesgue integral that have no riemann integral as part of the development of lebesgue integration lebesgue invented the concept of measure which extends the idea of length from intervals to a very large class of sets called measurable sets so more precisely simple functions are functions that take a finite number of values and each value is taken on a measurable set lebesgue s technique for turning a measure into an integral generalises easily to many other situations leading to the deficient in one respect the riemann integral generalises to the improper riemann integral to measure functions whose domain of definition is not a closed interval the lebesgue integral integrates many of these functions always reproducing the same answer when it did but not all of them for functions on the real line the henstock integral is an even more general notion of integral based on riemann s theory rather than lebesgue s that subsumes both lebesgue integration and improper riemann integration however the henstock integral depends on specific ordering features of the real line and so does not generalise to allow integration in more general spaces say manifolds while the lebesgue integral extends to such spaces quite naturally edith louisa cavell 4 december 1865 12 october 1915 was a british nurse she is celebrated for saving the lives of soldiers from both sides without distinction and in helping some 200 allied soldiers escape from german occupied belgium during the first world war for which she was arrested she was subsequently court martialled found guilty of treason and sentenced to death despite international pressure for mercy she was shot by a german firing squad her execution received worldwide condemnation and extensive press coverage she is well known for her statement that patriotism is not enough her strong anglican beliefs propelled her to help all those who needed it both german and allied soldiers she was quoted as saying i cant stop while there are lives to be saved 12 october is appointed for her commemoration in the anglican church although this is not a saint s feast day in the traditional sense edith cavell who was 49 at the time of her execution was already notable as a pioneer career edith cavell was born on 4 december 1865 in swardeston a village near norwich where her father was vicar for 45 years she was the eldest of the four children of the reverend frederick and louisa sophia cavell and was taught always to share with the less fortunate despite her familys meagre income after a period as a governess including for a family in brussels 18901895 she trained as a nurse at the london hospital under matron eva luckes and worked in various hospitals in england including shoreditch infirmary in 1907 cavell was recruited by dr antoine depage to be matron of a newly established nursing school l cole belge dinfirmires diplmes or the berkendael medical institute on the rue de la culture now rue franz merjay ixelles in brussels by 1910 miss cavell felt that the profession of nursing had gained sufficient foothold in belgium to warrant the publishing of a professional journal and therefore launched the nursing journal l infirmire a hospitals 24 schools and 13 kindergartens in belgium when the first world war broke out she was visiting her widowed mother in norfolk in the east of england she returned to brussels where her clinic and nursing school were taken over by the red cross first world war and execution in november 1914 after the german occupation of brussels cavell began sheltering british soldiers and funnelling them out of occupied belgium to the neutral netherlands wounded british and french soldiers and belgian and french civilians of military age were hidden from the germans and provided with false papers by prince reginald de croy at his chteau of bellignies near mons from there they were conducted by various guides to the houses of cavell louis sverin and others in brussels and furnished by them with money to reach the dutch frontier and with guides obtained through philippe baucq she was arrested on 3 august 1915 and charged with harbouring allied soldiers she had been betrayed by gaston quien who was later convicted by a was prosecuted for aiding british and french soldiers in addition to young belgian men to cross the border and eventually enter britain she admitted her guilt when she signed a statement the day before the trial cavell declared that the soldiers she had helped escape thanked her in writing when arriving safely in britain this admission confirmed that cavell had helped the soldiers navigate the dutch frontier but it also established that she helped them escape to a country at war with germany the penalty according to german military law was death paragraph 58 of the german military code said will be sentenced to death for treason any person who with the intention of helping the hostile power or of causing harm to the german or allied troops is guilty of one of the crimes of paragraph 90 of the german penal code the case referred to in the above mentioned paragraph 90 consists of conducting soldiers to the enemy additionally the penalties according to paragraph 160 of the german code in case of war first geneva convention ordinarily guaranteed protection of medical personnel that protection was forfeit if used as cover for any belligerent action this forfeiture is expressed in article 7 of the 1906 version of the convention which was the version in force at the time the german authorities instead justified prosecution merely on the basis of the german law and the interests of the german state the british government could do nothing to help her sir horace rowland of the foreign office said i am afraid that it is likely to go hard with miss cavell i am afraid we are powerless lord robert cecil under secretary for foreign affairs said any representation by us he advised will do her more harm than good the united states however had not yet joined the war and was in a position to apply diplomatic pressure hugh s gibson first secretary of the u s legation at brussels made clear to the german government that executing cavell would further harm germany s already damaged reputation later von der lancken of the burning of leuven baron von der lancken is known to have stated that cavell should be pardoned because of her complete honesty and because she had helped save so many lives german as well as allied however traugott von sauberzweig cavell was not arrested for espionage as many were led to believe but for treason when in custody cavell was questioned in french but the session was minuted in german this gave the interrogator the opportunity to misinterpret her answers although she may have been misrepresented she made no attempt to defend herself cavell was provided with a defender approved by the german military governor a previous defender who was chosen for cavell by her assistant elizabeth wilkins the night before her execution she told the reverend stirling gahan the anglican chaplain who had been allowed to see her and to give her holy communion patriotism is not enough i must have no hatred or bitterness towards anyone from his sick bed brand whitlock on cavell s behalf to moritz von bissing the governor general of belgium hugh gibson maitre g de leval the legal adviser to the united states legation and rodrigo saavedra y vinent 2nd marques de villalobar the spanish minister formed a midnight deputation of appeal for mercy or at least postponement of sentence there is also a dispute over the sentencing imposed under the german military code supposedly the death penalty relevant to the offence committed by cavell was not officially declared until a few hours after her death on instructions from the spanish minister belgian women immediately buried her body next to saint gilles prison role in first world war propaganda in the months and years following cavell s death countless newspaper articles pamphlets images and books publicised her story she became an iconic propaganda figure for military recruitment in britain and to help increase favourable sentiment towards the allies in the united states she was a popular icon because of her sex her nursing profession was represented as an act of german barbarism and moral depravity news reports shortly following cavell s execution were found to be only true in part even the american journal of nursing repeated the fictional account of cavell s execution in which she fainted and fell because of her refusal to wear a blindfold in front of the firing squad allegedly while she lay unconscious the german commanding officer shot her dead with a revolver numerous accounts like these stimulated international outrage and general anti german sentiments along with the invasion of belgium and the sinking of the rms lusitania because of the british government s decision to use cavell s story as propaganda she became the most prominent british female casualty of first world war the combination of heroic appeal and a resonant atrocity story narrative made cavell s case one of the most effective in british propaganda of the first world war as well as a factor in enduring post war anti german sentiment before the first world war cavell was not well known different depictions of her in british propaganda which ignored anything that did not fit this image including the suggestion that cavell during her interrogation had given information that incriminated others in november 1915 the british foreign office issued a denial that cavell had implicated anyone else in her testimony one image commonly represented was of cavell as an innocent victim of a ruthless and dishonourable enemy this view depicted her as innocent of espionage and was most commonly used in various forms of british propaganda such as postcards and newspaper illustrations during the war her story was presented in the british press as a means of fuelling a desire for revenge on the battlefield these images implied that men must enlist in the armed forces immediately in order to stop the murder of innocent british women another second representation of cavell during the first world war saw her described as a serious reserved brave and patriotic woman who devoted her life to nursing and died to save others this portrayal has been of the red cross nurse pastor le seur the german army chaplain recalled at the time of her execution i do not believe that miss cavell wanted to be a martyrbut she was ready to die for her country miss cavell was a very brave woman and a faithful christian german response unlike the rest of the world the german government thought that they had acted fairly towards cavell in a letter german undersecretary for foreign affairs dr alfred zimmermann not to be confused with arthur zimmerman german secretary for foreign affairs made a statement to the press on behalf of the german government from the germans perspective had they released cavell there would have been a surge in the number of women participating in acts against germany because they knew they would not be severely punished it was up to the responsible men to follow their legal duty to germany and ignore the worlds condemnation their laws do not make distinctions between sexes the only exception to this rule being probably this means pregnant condition could not be executed the german government also believed that all of the convicted people were thoroughly aware of the nature of their acts the court paid particular attention to this point releasing several accused persons because there was doubt as to whether the accused knew that their actions were punishable burial and memorials cavell s remains were returned to britain after the war and a state funeral was held at westminster abbey on 19 may 1919 her body was reburied at the east side of norwich cathedral a graveside service is still held each october the railway van that conveyed her remains from dover to london is kept as a memorial on the kent and east sussex railway and is usually open to view at bodiam railway station following cavell s death many memorials were created around the world to remember her one of the first was the one unveiled 12 october 1918 by alexandra of denmark in the calendar of saints church of england the day appointed for is a memorial in her honour rather than formal canonisation cavell is to be featured on a uk commemorative 5 coin part of a set to be issued in 2015 by the royal mint to mark the centenary of the war other honours include memorials a dedication on the war memorial on the grounds of sacred trinity church salford greater manchester uk a marble and stone memorial in kings domain in melbourne australia a memorial by henry alfred pegram outside norwich cathedral uk a

with any major league baseball team they were created by chico heat professional baseball llc with former supermarket entrepreneur steve nettleton and his wife kathy serving as principal owners general managers included bob linscheid who would go to become president of the wbl and jeff kragel now at chico state university and their mascot was the beloved heater the dragon not to be confused with the bakersfield blaze mascot of the same name the team began operations in 1997 the team immediately won the league championship in their inaugural season and although they did not win a championship in the four subsequent years they won the most regular season games in each of the following seasons they appeared in the championship series in five out of their six seasons in the league in 2002 chico won its second league championship in the league s and the team which is located on the campus of california state university chico they were preceded by the oroville chico red sox of the minor league s class c far west league from 1948 1951 and were succeeded by the chico outlaws of the independent golden baseball league taking their place in 2005 the heat has been the most

temple mount and eretz yisrael land of israel faithful movement is an orthodox jewish movement based in jerusalem israel whose goal is to rebuild the third jewish temple on the temple mount in jerusalem and re institute the practice of ritual sacrifice the movement was founded by former israel defense forces officer and middle eastern studies lecturer gershon salomon members of the movement are referred to as the temple mount faithful the group was established in 1967 on october 8 1990 seventeen palestinians were killed and over 100 others injured by israeli border police in the 1990 temple mount riots triggered by an announcement by the temple mount faithful that they were going to lay a cornerstone for a third jewish temple on the temple mount in jerusalem after the riots the police prohibited salomon from entering the temple mount his appeal of that decision was subsequently denied by israel s high court of justice the temple mount faithful was the first significant group to advocate the jewish takeover of the temple mount and during with that position initially the group presented its argument largely in terms of nationalistic rather than religious symbolism in a 1983 interview salomon stated that whoever controls the temple mount has rights over the land of israel over time gershon salomon developed a more religiously oriented apocalyptic and messianic platform which however was distinctly non orthodox in character tensions with the more orthodox elements in the group caused a formal split in 1987 when a more religiously oriented splinter group called the movement for the establishment of the temple was founded subsequently the influence of the temple mount faithful among the radical jewish activists gradually waned although the group still retains significant visibility the temple mount faithful functions as a protest movement but unlike some other radical jewish groups it attempts to operate within israeli law typically shortly before major jewish religious festivals the group requests a permit from the israeli police to enter the temple mount compound and conduct prayer services there these requests are routinely denied and are followed by high court also routinely permits the group to enter the site but not to pray there and such permit is contingent on the israeli police concluding that the security situation would allow such entry the police conclude that the entry can not be permitted for security reasons and the temple mount faithful are not allowed to enter the temple mount compound as a result their demonstrations usually proceed to the mograbi gate and are stopped by the police there outside of the compound in recent years salomon increasingly shifted the focus of the temple mount faithful in the apocalyptic and messianic direction and restoration of the jewish temple became one of the central objectives of the movement during the same period the movement developed close ties with christian fundamentalist circles and it receives significant financial assistance from some christian groups particularly in the u s footnotes ununpentium is the temporary name of a synthetic superheavy element in the periodic table that has the temporary symbol uup and has the atomic number 115 it is placed as a heavier homologue to bismuth and the heaviest member of group 15 va it was first observed in 2003 and about 50 atoms of ununpentium have been synthesized to date with about 25 direct decays of the parent element having been detected four consecutive isotopes are currently known sup 287290 sup uup with sup 289 sup uup having the longest measured half life of 200 ms on august 27 2013 researchers at gsi from lund university in sweden reported confirming the existence of the element on september 10 2013 researchers from the same research group working in darmstadt germany reported synthesis as well history discovery profile on february 2 2004 synthesis of ununpentium was reported in physical review c by a team composed of russian scientists at the joint institute for nuclear research national laboratory the team reported that they bombarded americium 243 with calcium 48 ions to produce four atoms of ununpentium these atoms they report decayed by emission of alpha particles to ununtrium in approximately 100 milliseconds 3 n the dubnalivermore collaboration has strengthened their claim for the discovery of ununpentium by conducting chemical experiments on the decay daughter sup 268 sup db in experiments in june 2004 and december 2005 the dubnium isotope was successfully identified by milking the db fraction and measuring any sf activities both the half life and decay mode were confirmed for the proposed sup 268 sup db which lends support to the assignment of z 115 to the parent nuclei sergei dmitriev from the flerov laboratory of nuclear reactions flnr in dubna russia has formally put forward their claim of discovery of ununpentium to the iupac iupap joint working party jwp in 2011 the iupac evaluated the dubnalivermore results and concluded that they did not meet the criteria for discovery naming ununpentium is historically known as eka bismuth temporary iupac

dubna are currently running another series of experiments on the sup 243 sup am sup 48 sup ca xn reaction they are attempting to complete the 4n excitation function and confirm the data for sup 287

the team in dubna in julyaugust 2003 in two separate runs they were able to detect 3 atoms of sup 288 sup uup and a single atom of sup 287 sup uup the reaction was studied further in june 2004 in an attempt to isolate the descendant sup 268 sup db from the sup 288 sup uup 15 sf decays were measured with a lifetime consistent with sup 268 sup db in order to prove that the decays were from dubnium 268 the team repeated the reaction in august 2005 and separated the 4 and 5 fractions and further separated the 5 fractions into tantalum like and niobium like ones five sf activities were observed all occurring in the 5 fractions and none in the tantalum like fractions proving that the product was indeed isotopes of dubnium in a series of experiments between october 2010 february 2011 scientists at the flnr studied this reaction at a range of excitation energies they were able to detect 21 atoms of sup 288 sup uup and one atom of sup 289 sup uup from the 2n exit channel this latter result was used to support the synthesis of ununseptium the 3n excitation function was completed with a maximum at 8 pb the data was consistent with that found in the first experiments in 2003 isotopes and nuclear properties chemical properties extrapolated chemical properties oxidation states the 7p series of chemical elements and the heaviest member of group 15 va in the periodic table below bismuth in this group each member is known to portray the group oxidation state of v but with differing stability for nitrogen the v state is very difficult to achieve due to the lack of low lying d orbitals and the inability of the small nitrogen atom to accommodate five ligands the v state is well represented for phosphorus arsenic and antimony however for bismuth it is rare due to the reluctance of the 6s sup 2 sup electrons to participate in bonding this effect is known as the inert pair effect and is commonly linked to relativistic stabilisation of the 6s orbitals it is expected that ununpentium will continue this trend and portray only iii and i oxidation states nitrogen i and bismuth i are known but rare and ununpentium i is likely to show some unique properties because of spin orbit coupling flerovium may display closed shell or noble gas like properties if this is the case ununpentium will likely sup sup will have the same electron configuration as flerovium chemistry ununpentium should display eka bismuth chemical properties and should therefore form a sesquioxide uup sub 2 sub oxygen stability all the reported above isotopes of element 115 obtained by nuclear collisions of lighter nuclei are severely neutron deficient because the proportion of neutrons to protons needed for maximum stability increases with atomic number the most stable isotope will probably be sup 299 sup uup with 184 neutrons a known magic closed shell number conferring exceptional stability making it with one further proton outside the magic number of 114 protons both the chemical and the nuclear homolog of sup 209 sup bi but the technology required to add the required neutrons presently does not exist this is because no known combination of target and projectile can result in the required neutrons it has been suggested that such a neutron rich isotope could be formed by quasifission fusion followed by fission of a massive nucleus multi nucleon transfer reactions in collisions of actinide nuclei or this would depend on the stability of the parent nuclei towards spontaneous fission in greek mythology the meliae meliai or meliades were nymphs of the ash tree whose name they shared they appeared from the drops of blood spilled when cronus castrated uranus according to hesiod theogony 187 from the same blood sprang the erinyes suggesting perhaps that the ash tree nymphs represented the fates in milder guise graves 6 4 and the giants from the meliae sprang the race of mankind of the age of bronze description the meliae belong to a class of sisterhoods whose nature is to appear collectively and who are invoked in the plural though genealogical myths especially in hesiod give them individual names such as melia but these are quite clearly secondary and carry no great weight burkert 1985 iii 3 2 the melia thus singled out is one of these daughters of oceanus by her brother the river god inachus she became the mother of io phoroneus aegialeus she

ash in the mountains of greece is the manna ash fraxinus ornus the meliae were nurses of the infant zeus in the cretan cave of dikte according to callimachus hymn to zeus they fed him honey of manna the ash tree sugar the standard 19th century us pharmacopeia the dispensatory of the united states of america 14th edition philadelphia 1878 said fermented honey preceded wine as an entheogen in the aegean world meliae the meliai were perhaps the same as the honey nymph meliai nurses of the god zeus ida and adrasteia the manna meli of the ash and the honey of bees were thought to be related and being regarded s theogony they were born aside the erinyes avengers of the castration of uranus and the gigantes in hesiod appear to be the kouretes protectors of the baby zeus as children born of the castration it would be proper that they are brothers should play a role in the downfall of cronus performer of the crime they were an overly aggressive race who incurred the wrath of zeus and were

personnel test as part of the city s application process his score on that test was above the range required by the police department to legally narrow down the list of who qualify according to the city jordan was too smart to join the police since in their experience his intelligence correlated with an increased risk of job dissatisfaction which in turn led to increased costs in hiring and

compounds that are similar to soap but are more soluble in hard water because the polar sulfonate of detergents is less likely than the polar carboxyl of soap to bind to calcium and other ions found in hard water in most household contexts the term detergent by itself refers specifically to laundry detergent or dish detergent as opposed to hand soap or other types of cleaning agents detergents are commonly available as powders or concentrated solutions detergents like soaps work because they are amphiphilic partly hydrophilic polar and partly hydrophobic non polar their dual nature facilitates the mixture of hydrophobic compounds like oil and grease with water because air is not hydrophilic detergents are also foaming agents to varying degrees chemical classification of depending on the electrical charge of the surfactants anionic detergents typical anionic detergents are alkylbenzenesulfonates the alkylbenzene portion of these anions is lipophilic and the sulfonate is hydrophilic two different varieties have been popularized those with branched alkyl groups and those with linear alkyl groups the former were largely phased out in economically advanced societies because they are poorly biodegradable an estimated 6 billion kilograms of anionic detergents are produced annually for domestic markets bile acids such as deoxycholic acid doc are anionic detergents produced by the liver to aid in digestion and absorption of fats and oils cationic detergents cationic detergents are similar to the anionic ones with a hydrophobic component but instead of the anionic sulfonate group the cationic surfactants have quaternary ammonium as the polar end the ammonium center is positively charged non ionic and zwitterionic detergents non ionic detergents are characterized by their uncharged hydrophilic headgroups typical non ionic detergents are based on polyoxyethylene or a glycoside common examples of the former include tween are also known as ethoxylates or pegylates and their metabolites nonylphenol glycosides have a sugar as their uncharged hydrophilic headgroup examples include octyl thioglucoside and maltosides hega and mega series detergents are similar possessing a sugar alcohol as headgroup zwitterionic detergents possess a net zero charge arising from the presence of equal numbers of 1 and 1 charged chemical groups examples include chaps see surfactants for more applications major applications of detergents laundry detergents one of the largest applications of detergents is for washing clothes the formulations are complex reflecting the diverse demands of the application and the highly competitive consumer market in general laundry detergents contain water softeners surfactants bleach enzymes brighteners fragrances and many other agents the formulation is strongly affected by the temperature of the cleaning water and varies from country to country fuel additives both carburetors and fuel injector

puts a particular emphasis on environmental issues an important early influence was the thought of the american anarchist henry david thoreau and his book walden as well as leo tolstoy and lise reclus in the late 19th century there emerged anarcho naturism as the fusion of anarchism and naturist philosophies within individualist anarchist circles in france spain cuba and portugal important contemporary currents are anarcho primitivism and social ecology early ecoanarchism henry david thoreau anarchism started to have an ecological view mainly in the writings of american anarchist and transcendentalist henry david thoreau in his book walden he advocates simple living and self sufficiency among natural surroundings in resistance to the advancement of industrial civilization the work is part personal declaration of independence social experiment voyage of spiritual discovery satire and manual for self reliance first published in 1854 it details thoreau s experiences over the course of two years two months walden pond amidst woodland owned by his friend and mentor ralph waldo emerson near concord massachusetts the book compresses the time into a single calendar year and uses passages of four seasons to symbolize human development by immersing himself in nature thoreau hoped to gain a more objective understanding of society through personal introspection simple living and self sufficiency were thoreau s other goals and the whole project was inspired by transcendentalist philosophy a central theme of the american romantic period as thoreau made clear in his book his cabin was not in wilderness but at the edge of town about two miles 3 km from his family home a such many have seen in thoreau one of the precursors of ecologism and anarcho primitivism represented today in john zerzan for george woodcock this attitude can be also motivated by certain idea of resistance to progress and of rejection of the growing materialism which is the nature of american society in the mid xix century john zerzan himself included the text excursions 1863 by against civilization readings and reflections from 1999 lise reclus lise reclus 15 march 1830 4 july 1905 also known as jacques lise reclus was a renowned french geographer writer and anarchist he produced his 19 volume masterwork la nouvelle gographie universelle la terre et les hommes universal geography over a period of nearly 20 years 18751894 in 1892 he was awarded the prestigious gold medal of the paris geographical society for this work despite his having been banished from france because of his political activism according to kirkpatrick sale for the authors of an anarchist faq reclus argued that a secret harmony exists between the earth and the people whom it nourishes and when imprudent societies let themselves violate this harmony they always end up regretting it similarly no contemporary ecologist would disagree with his comments that the truly civilised man and women understands that his or her nature is bound up with the interest of all and with that of nature and works to improve his domain reclus advocated nature conservation and opposed meat eating and cruelty to animals he was a vegetarian as a result his ideas are seen by some historians as anticipating the modern social ecology and animal rights movements shortly before his death reclus completed l homme et la terre 1905 in it he added to his previous greater works by considering humanity s development relative to its geographical environment reclus was also an early proponent of naturism anarcho naturism in the late 19th century anarchist naturism appeared as the union of anarchist and naturist philosophies mainly it had importance within individualist anarchist circles in spain france portugal and cuba anarcho naturism advocated vegetarianism free love nudism and an ecological world view within anarchist groups and outside them anarcho naturism promoted an ecological worldview small ecovillages and most prominently nudism as a way to avoid the artificiality of the industrial mass society of modernity naturist individualist anarchists saw the individual in his biological physical important promoters of this were henri zisly and emile gravelle who collaborated in la nouvelle humanit followed by le naturien le sauvage l ordre naturel amp la vie naturelle france richard d sonn comments on the influence of naturist views in the wider french anarchist movement zisly s political activity primarily aimed at supporting a return to natural life through writing and practical involvement stimulated lively confrontations within and outside the anarchist environment zisly vividly criticized progress and civilization which he regarded as absurd ignoble and filthy he openly opposed industrialization arguing that machines were inherently authoritarian defended nudism advocated a non dogmatic and non religious adherence to the laws of nature recommended a lifestyle based on limited needs and self sufficiency and disagreed with vegetarianism which he considered anti scientific cuba the historian kirwin r schaffer in his study of cuban anarchism anarchist movement alongside anarcho communism and anarcho syndicalism naturism was a global alternative health and lifestyle movement naturists focused on redefining one s life to live simply eat cheap but nutritious vegetarian diets and raise one s own food if possible the countryside was posited as a romantic alternative to urban living and some naturists even promoted what they saw as the healthful benefits of nudism globally the naturist movement counted anarchists liberals and socialists as its followers however in cuba a particular anarchist dimension evolved led by people like adrin del valle who spearheaded the cuban effort to shift naturism s focus away from only individual health to naturism having a social emancipatory function schaffer reports the influence that anarcho naturism had outside naturists circles so for instance nothing inherently prevented an anarcho syndicalist in the havana restaurant workers union from supporting the alternative health care programs of the anarcho naturists and seeing those alternative practices as revolutionary anarcho naturists promoted a rural ideal simple living and being in harmony with nature as ways to besides promoting an early twentieth century back to the land movement they used these romantic images of nature to illustrate how far removed a capitalist industrialized cuba had departed from an anarchist view of natural harmony the main propagandizer in cuba of anarcho naturism was the catalonia born adrin del valle aka palmiro de lidia over the following decades del valle became a constant presence in not only the anarchist press that proliferated in cuba but also mainstream literary publications from 1912 to 1913 he edited the freethinking journal el audaz then he began his largest publishing job by helping to found and edit the monthly alternative health magazine that followed the anarcho naturist line pro vida spain anarcho naturism was quite important at the end of the 1920s in the spanish anarchist movement in france later important propagandists of anarcho naturism include henri zisly and mile gravelle whose ideas were important in individualist anarchist circles in spain where federico urales pseudonym of joan montseny promoted the ideas of gravelle and zisly in the relation between anarchism and naturism gives way to the naturist federation in july 1928 and to the lv spanish naturist congress in september 1929 both supported by the libertarian movement however in the short term the naturist and libertarian movements grew apart in their conceptions of everyday life the naturist movement felt closer to the libertarian individualism of some french theoreticians such as henri ner real name of han ryner than to the revolutionary goals proposed by some anarchist organisations such as the fai federacin anarquista ibrica this ecological tendency in spanish anarchism was strong enough as to call the attention of the cntfai in spain daniel gurin in anarchism from theory to practice reports isaac puente isaac puente was an influential spanish anarchist during the 1920s and 1930s and an important propagandist of anarcho naturism was a militant of both the cnt anarcho syndicalist trade union and iberian anarchist federation he published the book el comunismo libertario y otras proclamas insurreccionales y and other insurrectionary and naturist proclaims in 1933 which sold around 100 000 copies and wrote the final document for the extraordinary confederal congress of zaragoza of 1936 which established the main political line for the cnt for that year puente was a doctor who approached his medical practice from a naturist point of view he saw naturism as an integral solution for the working classes alongside neo malthusianism and believed it concerned the living being while anarchism addressed the social being he believed capitalist societies endangered the well being of humans from both a socioeconomic and sanitary viewpoint and promoted anarcho communism alongside naturism as a solution other countries naturism also met anarchism in the united kingdom in many of the alternative communities established in britain in the early 1900s nudism anarchism vegetarianism and free love were accepted as part of a politically radical way of life in the 1920s the inhabitants of the anarchist community at whiteway near stroud in gloucestershire shocked the conservative residents of the area with their shameless the italian anarchist federation in carrara in 1965 a group decided to split off from this organization and created the gruppi di iniziativa anarchica in the seventies it was mostly composed of veteran individualist anarchists with an orientation of pacifism naturism etc american anarcho syndicalist sam dolgoff shows some of the criticism that some people on the other anarchist currents at the time had for anarcho naturist tendencies speaking of life at the stelton colony of new york in the 1930s noted with disdain that it like other colonies was infested by vegetarians naturists nudists and other cultists who sidetracked true anarchist goals one resident always went barefoot ate raw food mostly nuts and raisins and refused to use a tractor being opposed to machinery and he did n t want to abuse horses so he dug the earth himself such self proclaimed anarchists were in reality ox cart anarchists dolgoff said who opposed organization and wanted to return to a simpler life in an grumbled i am sick and tired of these half assed artists and poets who object to organization and want only to play with their belly buttons leo tolstoy and tolstoyanism russian christian anarchist and anarcho pacifist leo tolstoy is also recognized as an early influence in green anarchism the novelist was struck by the description of christian buddhist and hindu ascetic renunciation as being the path to holiness after reading passages such as the following which abound in schopenhauer s ethical chapters the russian nobleman chose poverty and formal denial of the will but this very necessity of involuntary suffering by poor people for eternal salvation is also expressed by that utterance of the savior matthew 19 24 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god therefore those who were greatly in earnest about their eternal salvation chose voluntary poverty when fate had denied this to them and they had been born in but voluntarily took to the mendicant s staff and francis of assisi the founder of the mendicant orders who as a youngster at a ball where the daughters of all the notabilities were sitting together was asked now francis will you not soon make your choice from these beauties and who replied i have made a far more beautiful choice whom la poverta poverty whereupon he abandoned every thing shortly afterwards and wandered through the land as a mendicant despite his misgivings about anarchist violence tolstoy took risks to circulate the prohibited publications of anarchist thinkers in russia and corrected the proofs of kropotkin s words of a rebel illegally published in st petersburg in 1906 tolstoy was enthused by the economic thinking of henry george incorporating it approvingly into later works such as resurrection the book that played a major factor in his excommunication tolstoyans identify themselves as christians but do not generally belong to an simple life preferring to be vegetarian non smoking teetotal and chaste tolstoyans are considered christian pacifists and advocate nonresistance in all circumstances they do not support or participate in the government which they consider immoral violent and corrupt tolstoy rejected the state as it only exists on the basis of physical force and all institutions that are derived from it the police law courts and army tolstoy influenced mohandas karamchand gandhi who set up a cooperative colony called tolstoy farm near johannesburg south africa having been inspired by tolstoy s ideas the colony comprising 1 100 acre was funded by the gandhian herman kallenbach and placed at the disposal of the satyagrahis from 1910 he also inspired similar communal experiments in the united states where the residents were also influenced by the views of henry george and edward bellamy as well as in russia england and the netherlands mid 20th century several anarchists from the mid 20th century including herbert read ethel mannin leopold kohr and paul goodman s 1944 book bread and roses a utopian survey and blue print has been described by anarchist historian robert graham as setting forth an ecological vision in opposition to the prevailing and destructive industrial organization of society leopold kohr leopold kohr 5 october 1909 in oberndorf bei salzburg austria 26 february 1994 in gloucester england was an economist philosopher and political scientist known both for his opposition to the cult of bigness in social organization and as one of those who initiated the small is beautiful movement for almost twenty years he was professor of economics and public administration at the university of puerto rico he described himself as a philosophical anarchist in 1937 kohr became a freelance correspondent during the spanish civil war where he was impressed by the limited self contained governments of the separatist states of catalonia and aragon as well as the small spanish anarchist city states of alcoy and caspe in his first published essay disunion now a plea for a society 1941 kohr wrote about a europe at war we have ridiculed the many little states now we are terrorized by their few successors he called for the breakup of europe into hundreds of city states kohr developed his ideas in a series of books including the breakdown of nations 1957 development without aid 1973 and the overdeveloped nations 1977 from leopold kohr s most popular work the breakdown of nations there seems to be only one cause behind all forms of social misery bigness oversimplified as this may seem we shall find the idea more easily acceptable if we consider that bigness or oversize is really much more than just a social problem it appears to be the one and only problem permeating all creation whenever something is wrong something is too big and if the body of a people becomes diseased with the fever of aggression not because it has fallen victim to bad leadership or mental derangement it is because human beings so charming as individuals or in small aggregations have been welded into overconcentrated social units later in his academic and writing career he protested the cult of bigness and economic growth and promoted the concept of human scale and small community life he argued that massive external aid to poorer nations stifled local initiatives and participation his vision called for a dissolution of centralized political and economic structures in favor of local control kohr was an important inspiration to the green bioregional fourth world decentralist and anarchist movements kohr contributed often to john papworth s journal for the fourth world resurgence one of kohr s students was economist e f schumacher another prominent influence on these movements whose best selling book small is beautiful took its title from one of kohr s core principles similarly his ideas inspired kirkpatrick sale s books human scale 1980 bioregional vision 1985 sale arranged the first american publication of the breakdown of nations in 1978 and wrote the foreword murray bookchin murray bookchin january 14 1921 july 30 2006 was an american libertarian socialist author orator and philosopher in 1958 murray bookchin defined himself as an anarchist seeing parallels between anarchism and ecology his first book our synthetic environment was published under the pseudonym lewis herber in 1962 a few months before rachel carson s silent spring the book described a broad range of environmental ills but received little attention because of its political radicalism his groundbreaking essay ecology and revolutionary thought introduced ecology as a concept in radical politics in 1968 he founded another group that published the influential anarchos magazine which published that and other innovative essays on post scarcity and on ecological technologies such as solar and wind energy and on decentralization and miniaturization lecturing of ecology to the counterculture post scarcity anarchism is a collection of essays written by murray bookchin and first published in 1971 by ramparts press it outlines the possible form anarchism might take under conditions of post scarcity it is one of bookchin s major works and its radical thesis provoked controversy for being utopian and messianic in its faith in the liberatory potential of technology bookchin argues that post industrial societies are also post scarcity societies and can thus imagine the fulfillment of the social and cultural potentialities latent in a technology of abundance the self administration of society is now made possible by technological advancement and when technology is used in an ecologically sensitive manner the revolutionary potential of society will be much changed in 1982 his book the ecology of freedom had a profound impact on the emerging ecology movement both in the united states and abroad he was a principal figure in the burlington greens in 1986 90 an ecology group that ran candidates for city council on a program to cities originally published in 1987 as the rise of urbanization and the decline of citizenship bookchin traced the democratic traditions that influenced his political philosophy and defined the implementation of the libertarian municipalism concept a few years later the politics of social ecology written by his partner of 20 years janet biehl briefly summarized these ideas jacques ellul jacques ellul january 6 1912 may 19 1994 was a french philosopher law professor sociologist lay theologian and christian anarchist he wrote several books about christianity the technological society propaganda and the interaction between religion and politics professor of history and the sociology of institutions on the faculty of law and economic sciences at the university of bordeaux he authored 58 books and more than a thousand articles over his lifetime in all the dominant theme of which has been the threat to human freedom and religion created by modern technique the ellulian concept of technique is the technological society 1964 what many consider to be ellul s most important work the technological society 1964 was originally titled la technique l enjeu du sicle literally the stake of the century in it ellul set forth seven characteristics of modern technology that make efficiency a necessity rationality artificiality automatism of technical choice self augmentation monism universalism and autonomy for ellul the rationality of technique enforces logical and mechanical organization through division of labor the setting of production standards etc and it creates an artificial system which eliminates or subordinates the natural world today he argues the technological society is generally held sacred cf saint steve jobs since he defines technique as the totality of methods rationally arrived at and having absolute efficiency for a given stage of development in every field of human activity it is clear that his sociological analysis focuses not on the society efficient techniques contemporary developments notable contemporary writers espousing green anarchism include derrick jensen jaime semprun george draffan john zerzan starhawk and alan carter social ecology and communalism social ecology is closely related to the work and ideas of murray bookchin and influenced by anarchist peter kropotkin social ecologists assert that the present ecological crisis has its roots in human social problems and that the domination of human over nature stems from the domination of human over human bookchin later developed a political philosophy to complement social ecology which he called communalism spelled with a capital c to differentiate it from other forms of communalism while originally conceived as a form of social anarchism he later developed communalism into a separate ideology which incorporates what he saw as the most beneficial elements of anarchism marxism syndicalism and radical ecology politically communalists advocate a network of directly democratic citizens assemblies in individual communities cities organized in a confederal fashion this method used to achieve this is called libertarian municipalism which involves the establishment of with the goal of eventually replacing the nation state janet biehl born 1953 is a writer associated with social ecology the body of ideas developed and publicized by murray bookchin in 1986 she attended the institute for social ecology and there began a collaborative relationship with bookchin working intensively with him over the next two decades in the explication of social ecology from their shared home in burlington vermont from 1987 to 2000 she and bookchin co wrote and co published the theoretical newsletter green perspectives later renamed left green perspectives she is the editor and compiler of the murray bookchin reader 1997 the author of the politics of social ecology libertarian municipalism 1998 and rethinking ecofeminist politics 1991 and coauthor with peter staudenmaier of ecofascism lessons from the german experience 1995

the magazine was launched in the summer of that year by an editorial collective consisting of alan albon richard hunt and marcus christo early issues featured a range of broadly anarchist and ecological ideas bringing together groups and individuals as varied as class war veteran anarchist writer colin ward anarcho punk band crass as well as the peace convoy anti nuclear campaigners animal rights activists and so on however the diversity that many saw as the publication s greatest strength quickly led to irreconcilable arguments between the essentially pacifist approach of albon and christo and the advocacy of violent confrontation with the state favoured by hunt during the 1990s green anarchist came under the helm of an editorial collective that included paul rogers steve booth and others during which period the publication became increasingly aligned with primitivism an anti civilization philosophy advocated by writers such as john 1995 hampshire police began a series of at least 56 raids code named operation washington that eventually resulted in the august to november 1997 portsmouth trial of green anarchist editors booth saxon wood noel molland and paul rogers as well as animal liberation front alf press officer robin webb and animal liberation front supporters group alfsg newsletter editor simon russell the defendants organised the gandalf defence campaign three

retelling of history through the hobbesian metaphor of the leviathan the book remains a major source of inspiration for anti civilization of philosopher john zerzan anarcho primitivism anarcho primitivism is an anarchist critique of the origins and progress of civilization according to anarcho primitivism the shift from hunter gatherer to agricultural subsistence gave rise to social stratification coercion and alienation anarcho primitivists advocate a return to non civilized ways of life through deindustrialisation abolition of the division of labour or specialization and abandonment of large scale organization technologies there are other non anarchist forms of primitivism and not all primitivists point to the same phenomenon as the source of modern civilized problems anarcho primitivists are often distinguished by their focus on the praxis of achieving a feral state of being through rewilding john zerzan john zerzan is an american anarchist and primitivist philosopher and author his works criticize agricultural civilization as inherently oppressive and advocate drawing upon the ways of life of hunter gatherers as an inspiration for what a free society should look like some subjects of his criticism include domestication language symbolic thought such as mathematics and art and the concept of time refusal 1988 future primitive and other essays 1994

started towards the end of 1999 in the aftermath of the massive street protests in eugene reclaim the streets and in seattle wto of that year that aftermath gave a new voice and standing for green anarchist and anarcho primitivist writers and viewpoints within both the anarchist milieu and the culture at large the first issue came out in winter of 2000 2001 currently out of print and contained a mix of reprints and some original articles from derrick jensen and john zerzan among others issue two came in the following year step from the first issue in becoming something of its own rather than another mouthpiece of green anarchist rhetoric the articles took a more in depth direction opening a more analytical and critical draw between anarchy and anthropology attacks on reason and the progress linear views of human history and future that stand at the base of the ideology of civilization vegan anarchism veganarchism or vegan anarchism is the political philosophy of veganism more specifically animal liberation and earth liberation and anarchism creating a combined praxis that is designed to be a means for social revolution this encompasses viewing the state as unnecessary and harmful to animals both human and non human whilst practising a vegan lifestyle it is either perceived as a combined theory or that both philosophies are essentially the same it is further described as an anti speciesist perspective on green anarchism or an anarchist perspective on animal liberation veganarchists typically view oppressive dynamics within society to be interconnected from statism racism and sexism to human supremacy and redefine veganism as a those who believe in veganarchy can be either against reform for animals or for it although do not limit goals to changes within the law derrick jensen derrick jensen is an american author and environmental activist and critic of mainstream environmentalism living in crescent city california jensen s work is sometimes characterized as anarcho primitivist although he has categorically rejected that label describing primitivist as a racist way to describe indigenous peoples he prefers to be called indigenist or an ally to the indigenous because indigenous peoples have had the only sustainable human social organizations and we need to recognize that we colonizers are all living on stolen land a language older than words uses the lens of domestic violence to look at the larger violence of western culture the culture of make believe begins by exploring racism and misogyny and moves to examine how this cultures economic system leads inevitably to hatred and atrocity strangely like war is about deforestation it begins as is true for most people i know ive always loved learning as is also true for most people i know i always hated school why is that welcome to the machine is about surveillance and more broadly about science and what he perceives to be a western obsession with control resistance against empire

editor of the nonproliferation review on nukes alfred mccoy politics and heroin christian parenti the us prison system katherine albrecht on rfid and robert mcchesney on freedom of the media conducted between 1999 and 2004 endgame is about what he describes he asks do you believe that this culture will undergo a voluntary transformation to a sane and sustainable way of living nearly everyone he talks to says no his next question is how would this understanding that this culture will not voluntarily stop destroying the natural world eliminating indigenous cultures exploiting the poor and killing those who resist shift our strategy and tactics the answer nobody knows because we never talk about it were too busy pretending the culture will undergo a magical transformation endgame he says is about that shift in strategy and in tactics jensen co wrote the book deep green resistance strategy to save the planet with lierre keith and aric mcbay crimethinc crimethinc is a decentralized

the town has a total area of 1 5 square miles 3 8 km all land etymology there is much confusion about the mysterious name ninety six and the true origin may never be known speculation has led to a romantic indian myth to the mistaken belief that it was 96 miles to the nearest cherokee settlement of keowee to a counting of creeks crossing the main road leading from lexington sc to ninety six sc to an interpretation of a welsh expression nant sych meaning dry gulch however no one is able to confirm that robert goudey was welsh english scottish or german an examination of early maps indicates markings such as 30 and 60 and 90 at different points possibly indicating it is possible that parish linear measurements used in england were used on colonial maps to measure distances in chains in england according to a british and welsh booklet designating linear measurements parish maps used a rule of 4 chains to the inch in using that parish rule on an early map of colonial south carolina 90 chains on a map would probably cover approximately 24 inches the map distance from saxe gotha modern lexington sc to ninety six using the same measurements for the distance from ninety six to the savannah river the measurement would be approximately 2 5 inches or 6 chains hence 96 even so the origin of the name ninety six likely remains a mystery history ninety six was established on the

students and other jews with a strong connection to the orthodox yeshiva world research only a few serious studies have been written about yeshivish the first is a master s thesis by steven ray goldfarb university of texas at el paso 1979 called a sampling of lexical items in yeshiva english the work lists defines and provides examples for nearly 250 yeshivish words and phrases the second more comprehensive work is frumspeak the first dictionary of yeshivish by chaim weiser weiser 1995 maintains that yeshivish is not a pidgin creole or an independent language nor is it precisely a jargon he refers to it instead with tongue in cheek as a shprach a yiddish word meaning language or rapport baumel 2006 following weiser notes that yeshivish differs from english in three ways katz describes it in words on fire the unfinished of english which is taking over as the vernacular in everyday life in some circles in america and elsewhere heilman 2006 and others consider code switching a part of yeshivish though kaye 1991 would exclude english speakers in the context of a yeshiva studying the talmud from code switching where he considers the terms yiddish english or yiddishized english yinglish may be more appropriate relation to other languages english the english variant of yeshivish consists of grammatical irregularities borrowed from yiddish and a vocabulary consisting of yiddish rabbinic hebrew talmudic aramaic and sometimes modern hebrew the speaker will use those terms instead of their english counterpart either because of cultural affinity or lack of the appropriate english term yiddish the yiddish variant of yeshivish is questionable as a definition in itself since the grammar remains identical to that of yiddish it may be argued that the yiddish variant of yeshivish is a new phenomenon and consists of less germanic terms and more aramaic on the secular and cultural variants of yiddish and may be attributed to the fact that yivo the forerunner of yiddish as an academic study was founded by secular jews who themselves were unlikely to be educated in yeshivas and also removed by one or more generations from yeshiva educated speakers however the yeshivish dialect of yiddish has existed for quite a few centuries among yeshiva educated jews in eastern and central europe however as a result of the holocaust world war ii and immigration the secular speaking yiddish community is very small and is far outnumbered by religious yiddish speaking communities in new york antwerp jerusalem b nei beraq london and others making the predominant contemporary yiddish dialect that of the yeshivish variant hebrew the yeshivish dialect of hebrew consists of occasional ashkenazic pronunciation and various yiddishisms within modern hebrew spoken among haredi communities in israel while many terms from the talmud and mishna exist in modern hebrew their pronunciation is in line with modern hebrew whereas in the yeshivish variant they maintain present in yeshivish hebrew these are not distinct to the yeshivish dialect and can be found in mainstream modern hebrew as well patterns of usage yeshivish is primarily a male spoken dialect fathers and sons particularly of teenage years and above might speak yeshivish while mothers and daughters generally do not or they speak a milder variety of it this can be explained as much of the yeshivish lexicon is learnt in yeshivot where the studying takes place using a specialist nomenclature familiarity with these terms develops and they are then re applied to other situations there is a higher incidence of yeshivish being spoken amongst orthodox jews that are regularly involved in torah study or belong to a community that promotes its study commonly used platitudes amongst orthodox jews are frequently expressed with their yeshivish equivalent examples include substituting shkoikh for thank you a contraction from the hebrew yashar koach which literally translates as may your strength be firm and is used to indicate to someone that they have done a sometimes written as b h meaning blessed is the name of god yeshivish dialogue may include many expressions that refer to god or hashem neophyte orthodox jews might overcompensate in their efforts to assimilate to the community s parlance and speak a stilted artificial form of yeshivish words might be used in an incorrect context and pronounced in an unusual manner another tendency of baalei teshuva is to cite excessive godly references in their speech some observers predict that the english variant of yeshivish may develop further to the point that it could become one of the historical judeo hybrid languages like yiddish ladino or judeo arabic the judeo hybrid languages were spoken dialects which mixed elements of the local vernacular hebrew aramaic and jewish religious idioms as yiddish was to middle high german yeshivish may be to standard american english however the integration of modern day jews with non jews may keep their speech from diverging as far from the standard language as it did in the past distinct features vocabulary the vocabulary and grammatical native language see above although it includes scholarly jargon primarily from the talmud and acharonim in yiddish hebrew and aramaic in many sentences however the grammatical and lexical features of the speaker s native language is slight and sometimes even lacking altogether a distinguishing feature of yeshivish is that its speakers knowingly apply highly technical and literal written language to a colloquial language and in common day usage similar to modern hebrew for example he caused a lot of nezek but l basoif was moideh b miktzas and claimed he was shoigeg nezek in its original context refers to the talmudic notion of tort law l basoif means eventually moideh b miktzas refers to partial confession of a defendant and shoigeg in its original context means an incident which was caused unwillingly but was a result of partial negligence despite its heavy borrowing of technical and legal terms the above sentence would be understood clearly by speakers of eventually admitted that he did it although he claimed it was inadvertent note in the above example that shoigeg does not have the same meaning in yeshivish as it does in its original context wherein it implies negligence oines would be the correct technical term but it may be argued that there is less preference for oines in yeshivish due to its meaning in modern hebrew of rape phonology the yeshivish accent has similarities to various accents of eastern european and new york backgrounds one notable feature of yeshivish is the frequency of occurrence of the phoneme x common in many words of hebrew aramaic and yiddish origin t may be released when in general american it would be flapped or unreleased final stops may devoice and pre nasal may not raise discourse and prosody yeshivish may use a chanting intonation for reading and discussing jewish texts a number of other distinctive intonations are also used for instance a click is used borrowed from israeli hebrew but sometimes it s more click i do n t know how to explain it yeshivish has some unique interjections for instance oh and psshhhh may be used as praise markers grammar morphology loan words are often given plurals using standard english morphology for instance the plural of yeshiva is yeshivas rather than yeshivois as in ashkenazi hebrew although this is similar to the plural form in yiddish hebrew nouns ending in us are pluralized with the suffix in rather than replacing us with uyois as in ashkenazi hebrew e g shlichus shlichusin mission and mashmaus mashmausin implication this likely comes from the yiddish plural marker n although it could also loan verbs may also conjugate with standard english patterns for example yiddish derived daven pray may become davening or davened e g i already davened mincha and quiet i m davening syntax and semantics some verbs particularly those of hebrew origin are often treated as participles and inflected by english auxiliary verbs in the same way that periphrastic verbs are constructed in yiddish for example he was takeh moideh that he was wrong he admitted that he was takeh indeed actually wrong he was puts moideh to admit into the third person singular past tense we ll always be soimech on rav plony s p sak that the eruv is kosher we ll always rely upon rabbi so and so s ruling that the eruv is usable we ll always be rely into the first person plural future tense there are a number of phrasal verbs calqued from yiddish for instance bring down and tell over recount retell a story modals may be used differently than in standard english e g i want that you should get her number there are a number of differences between the use of prepositions in yeshivish and standard english the preposition by has a wide array of meanings in yeshivish are you eating by rabbi fischer at the house of by chabad it s different with among a possible cause for this is that the yiddish preposition bei defines as at beside or by the similar sounding english preposition by has come to encompass these meanings prepositions are often dropped her bus gets in 10 15 20 years east dunbartonshire is one of the 32 council areas of scotland it borders onto the north west of the city of glasgow it contains many of

columbia retaining ownership over the 34 disputed films origin of name as a young man cantinflas performed a variety of acts in travelling tents and it was here that he acquired the nickname cantinflas although the origin of the name is obscured by legend according to one obituary parents from knowing he was in the entertainment business which they considered a shameful occupation in another version the mexican media critic and theorist carlos monsivis cites a legendary account of the origin of cantinflas characteristic speech entertainment career before starting his professional life in entertainment he explored a number of possible careers such as medicine and professional boxing before joining the entertainment world as a dancer by 1930 he was involved in mexico city s carpa travelling tent circuit performing in succession with the ofelia sotelo of azcapotzalco and finally the valentina carpa where he met his future wife at first he tried to imitate al jolson by smearing his face with black paint but later separated himself to form his own identity as an impoverished slum dweller with baggy pants a rope for a belt and a distinctive mustache in the tents he danced performed acrobatics and performed roles related to several different professions and producer santiago reachi and subsequently partnered with him to form their own film production venture reachi produced directed and distributed while cantinflas acted cantinflas made his film debut in 1936 with no te engaes corazn before meeting reachi but the film received little attention reachi established posa films in 1939 with two partners cantinflas and fernandez before this reachi producedshort films that allowed him to develop the cantinflas character but it was in 1940 that he finally became a movie star after shooting ah est el detalle there s the rub literally there lies the detail with sofa lvarez joaqun pardav sara garca and dolores camarillo the phrase that gave that movie its name became a cantinflas or catchphrase for the remainder of his career the film was a breakthrough in latin america and was later recognized by somos magazine as the 10th greatest film produced largely in mexico in 1941 moreno first el gendarme desconocido the unknown police officer a play on words on the unknown soldier by this time he had sufficiently distinguished the peladito character from the 1920s era pelado and his character flowed comfortably from the disenfranchised marginalized underclassman to the empowered public servant the rhetoric of cantinflismo facilitated this fluidity he would reprise the role of agent 777 and be honored by police forces throughout latin america for his positive portrayal of law enforcement ni sangre ni arena neither blood nor sand a play on words on the bullfighter gladiator phrase blood and sand 1941 film the 1940s and 1950s were cantinflas heyday in 1941 he rejected mexican film companies and instead signed with columbia pictures by this time his popularity was such that he was able to lend his prestige to the cause of mexican labor representing the national association of actors in talks with president of his theatrical work yo coln i columbus in the teatro de los insurgentes the same theatre that had earlier been embroiled in a controversy over a diego rivera mural incorporating cantinflas and the virgin of guadalupe critics including the pan and archbishop luis mara martnez called the mural blasphemous and it was eventually painted without the image of the virgin yo coln placed cantinflas in the character of christopher columbus who while continually discovering america made comical historical and contemporary observations from fresh perspectives the jokes changed nightly and moreno continued to employ his word games and double entendres to jab at politicians in 1956 around the world in eighty days cantinflas american debut earned him a golden globe for best actor in a musical or comedy variety magazine said in 1956 that his chaplinesque quality made a big contribution to the success of the film the film ultimately made an unadjusted 42 million dollars while david niven was billed as the lead in english speaking nations cantinflas was billed as the lead elsewhere as a result of the film cantinflas became the world s best paid actor moreno s second hollywood feature pepe attempted to replicate the success of his first the film had cameo appearances by frank sinatra judy garland and other stars his humor deeply rooted in the spanish language did not translate well for the american audience and the movie was a notorious box office disappointment he still earned a golden globe nomination for his part later in a 1992 american interview moreno cited the language barrier as the biggest impediment to his making it big in the united states after returning to mexico cantinflas starred in the comic drama el bolero de raquel 1957 the first cantinflas film to be distributed to the united states by columbia pictures the film was followed by three more 27 27972 toolong productions el padrecito 1964 and su excelencia 1967 after su excelencia cantinflas began to appear in a series of low budget comedies also directed by miguel m delgado which were produced by his own company cantinflas films these films lasted until el barrendero in 1982 like charlie chaplin cantinflas was a social satirist he played el pelado an impoverished everyman with hopes to succeed with mutual admiration cantinflas was influenced by chaplin s earlier films and ideology el circo the circus was a shadow of chaplin s silent film the circus and si yo fuera diputado if i were a congressman had many similarities with the 1940 film the great dictator cantinflas films to this day still generate revenue for columbia pictures in 2000 columbia reported in an cultural impact among the things that endeared him to his public was his comic use of language in his films his characters all of which were really variations of the main cantinflas persona but cast in different social roles and circumstances would strike up a normal conversation and then complicate it to the point where no one understood what they were talking about the cantinflas character was particularly adept at obfuscating the conversation when he owed somebody money was courting an attractive young woman or was trying to talk his way out of trouble with authorities whom he managed to humiliate without their even being able to tell this manner of talking became known as cantinflada and it became common parlance for spanish speakers to say ests cantinfleando loosely translated as you re pulling a cantinflas or you re cantinflassing whenever someone became hard to understand in conversation the real academia espaola officially included the verb cantinflear cantinflas dictionary in 1992 in the visual arts mexican artists such as rufino tamayo and diego rivera painted cantinflas as a symbol of the mexican everyman the american electronic dance music band mindless self indulgence released a song about cantinflas called whipstickagostop cantinflas style and the content of his films have led scholars to conclude that he influenced the many teatros that spread the message of the chicano movement during the 1960s 1970s in the united states the most important of which was el teatro campesino the teatro movement was an important part of the cultural renaissance that was the social counterpart of the political movement for the civil rights of mexican americans cantinflas use of social themes and style is seen as a precursor to chicano theater a cartoon series the cantinflas show was made in 1972 starring an animated cantinflas the show was targeted for children and was intended to be educational

shakespeare s romeo and juliet as well learning how important water and oil is and educational parodies of some of his famous movies like su excelencia la carta with incidental music from aaron copeland s el salon mexico in the second version his character was known as little amigo and concentrated on a wide range of subjects intended to educate children from the origin of soccer to the reasons behind the international date line the second animated series animated in 1979 and dubbed in english in 1982 was a joint venture between televisa and hanna barbera and mario morenos voiced

sometimes seen as a mexican groucho marx character one who uses his skill with words to puncture the pretensions of the wealthy and powerful the police and the government historian and author of cantinflas and the chaos of mexican modernity writes cantinflas symbolized the underdog who triumphed through trickery over more powerful opponents and presents cantinflas as a self image of a transitional mexico gregorio luke executive director of the museum of latin american art said to understand cantinflas is to understand what happened in mexico during the last century monsivis interprets spoken word in the context of mexico s reigning illiteracy 70 in 1930 particularly in the film el analfabeto the illiterate cantinflas is the illiterate who takes control of the language by

every catholic believes that when asked if he had seen recent evidence of the devil scalia replied you know it is curious in the gospels the devil is doing all sorts of things he people and whatnot what he s doing now is getting people not to believe in him or in god he s much more successful that way senior jennifer 2013 new york magazine october 14 2013 p 26 in another 2013 interview scalia stated that in order for capitalism to work in order for it to produce a good and stable society traditional christian virtues are essential in 2006 scalia approached by a reporter upon leaving church was asked if being a traditional catholic had caused problems for him he responded by asking you know what i say to those people and with a gesture cupping his hand under his chin and flicking his fingers out the gesture which was captured by a photographer was initially reported by the boston herald as obscene scalia responded to the reports with a letter to the editor accusing the news staff

conservatives many liberals dislike his views in march 2009 openly gay congressman barney frank described him as a homophobe ref citation rossum writing in 2006 before george w bush appointees john roberts his dislike of legislative history may be a reason why other justices have become more cautious in its use gregory maggs wrote in the public interest law review in 1995 that by the early 1990s legislative supreme court cases involving the interpretation of statutes and no case of that era used legislative history as an essential reason for the outcome maggs suggested with justice scalia breathing down the necks of anyone who peeks into the congressional record or senate reports the other members of the court may have concluded that the benefit of citing legislative history does not outweigh its costs it is likely for this reason that the percentage of cases citing it has decreased dramatically no one likes an unnecessary fight especially not one with as formidable an opponent as

hur short florence turner how to cure a cold short a gambit from ancient italian gambetto meaning tripping is a chess opening in which a player more often white sacrifices material usually a pawn with the hope of achieving a resulting advantageous position some well known examples are the king s gambit 1 e4 e5 2 f4 queen s gambit 1 d4 d5 2 c4 and evans gambit 1 e4 e5 2 nf3 nc6 3 bc4 bc5 4 b4 a gambit used by black may also be called a gambit e g the latvian gambit 1 e4 e5 2 nf3 f5 or englund gambit 1 d4 e5 but is sometimes called a countergambit e g the albin countergambit 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e5 and greco counter gambit an old fashioned name for the latvian gambit the word gambit was originally applied to chess openings in 1561 by spain strategy class toccolours style margin 0 0 1em 1em border none font size 95 clear e f g h a b c d e f g h gambits are often said to be offered to an opponent and that offer is then said to be either accepted or declined if a player who is offered a gambit captures the piece and thus gains material the gambit is said to be accepted if the player who was offered the gambit ignores it and instead continues his or her development then the gambit is said to be declined in modern chess the typical response to a moderately sound gambit is to accept the material and give the material back at an advantageous time for gambits that are less sound the accepting player is more likely to try to hold onto his extra material a rule of thumb often found in various primers on chess suggests that a player should get three moves see tempo of development for a sacrificed pawn but it is unclear how useful this general maxim is since the free moves part of the compensation of course a player is not obliged to accept a gambit often a gambit can be declined without disadvantage soundness a gambit is said to be sound if it is capable of procuring some concession from the opponent there are three general criteria in which a gambit is often said to be sound time gain the player accepting the gambit must take time to procure the sacrificed material and possibly must use more time to reorganize his pieces after the material is taken generation of differential activity often a player accepting a gambit will decentralize his pieces or pawns and his poorly placed pieces will allow the gambiteer to place his own pieces and pawns on squares that might otherwise have been inaccessible in addition bishops and rooks can become more active simply because the loss of pawns often gives rise to open file chess generation of positional weaknesses finally accepting a gambit may lead to a compromised pawn structure holes or other positional deficiencies a good example of e5 2 nf3 nc6 3 d4 exd4 4 bc4 here black can force white to sacrifice a pawn speculatively with 4 bb4 but white gets very good compensation for one pawn after 5 c3 dxc3 6 bxc3 or for two pawns after 6 0 0 inviting 6 cxb2 7 bxb2 due to the development advantage and attacking chances against the black king as a result black is often advised not to try to hold onto the extra pawn a more dubious gambit is the so called halloween gambit 1 e4 e5 2 nf3 nc6 3 nc3 nf6 4 nxe5 nxe5 5 d4 here the investment a knight for just one pawn is too large for the moderate advantage of having a strong center examples king s gambit 1 e4 e5 2 f4 queen s gambit 1 d4 d5 2 c4 evans gambit 1 e4

80km mi to the thames at east molesey opposite hampton court palace the river gives its name to the surrey district of mole valley the mole crosses the north downs between dorking and leatherhead where it cuts a steep sided valley known as the mole gap through the chalk much of the catchment area lies on impermeable rock including wealden clay and london clay meaning that the river level responds rapidly to heavy rainfall during the second half of the 20th century pollution levels in the river were high however since 1995 the water quality has improved dramatically and the mole now boasts the greatest diversity of fish species of any river in england twelve sites of special scientific interest sssis that include wetland habitats are located within the mole catchment area and the stretch of river through leatherhead has been designated a local nature reserve of conservation and is an sssi of european importance the river has captured the imagination of several authors and poets particularly since in very hot summers the river channel can become dry between dorking and leatherhead most recently during the 1976 drought in john speed s 1611 map of surrey this stretch of the river is denoted by a series of hills accompanied by the legend the river runneth under however the river s name is unlikely to have derived from this behaviour the oxford dictionary of english place names suggests that mole either comes from the latin mola a mill or is a back formation from molesey mul s island domesday book lists twenty mills on the river in 1086 of which sidlow mill was the oldest dating from saxon times catchment area the drainage area of the river mole is 512 km and forms 5 of the river thames catchment area above teddington annually the catchment average level of rainfall is 800 mm rain around crawley the mole catchment reaches a maximum elevation of 265m ft above ordnance datum at leith hill to the south west of dorking there is only one aquifer in the drainage basin at fetcham which means that the majority of the water in the river is from surface drainage particularly from gatwick airport and the urban areas of horley and crawley and that the flow rate responds rapidly to rainfall course upper mole river mole rises in baldhorns copse 0 7kmmi 1 to the south of the village of rusper in west sussex the river flows initially southwards for 1kmmi 1 to a small lake at baldhorns park before running eastwards through a largely rural area towards crawley the first tributaries to join the young river drain the northernmost part of st leonard s forest between horsham and crawley although much of the forest is in the catchment area of the river arun the mole skirts the northern suburbs of crawley where it is joined by ifield mill pond the first gauging station on the mole is south of gatwick airport 57 m above od 16 3929 ref the gauging station south of gatwick airport was installed in 2005 replacing an earlier station located 200 m 200 yds downstream the mean flow is 0 33m3 s cuft s and the river ran dry at this point for the first time in the summer of 1995 the mole runs under the airport runway in a culvert completed in 1985 the course of the mole within the airport perimeter has been altered several times since commercial flights began in 1945 however the meanders visible on the 1839 tithe map in the 1 5 km stretch immediately north of the runway were reinstated in 1999 in a 1 2 million project to facilitate airport expansion the mole enters surrey to the south of horley where it meets the gatwick stream a tributary draining worth forest to the southeast of crawley the second largest sewage treatment works stw in the mole catchment is located on the gatwick stream 3km mi upstream 15 megalitres 15 000 m sup 3 sup of water per day and in prolonged dry periods it accounts for up to 75 of the flow of the mole downstream of the confluence the mean flow measured at horley gauging station 52 m above od is

manor gauging station 48 m above od the earlswood brook a tributary draining the urban area of reigate and redhill joins the mole at sidlow the largest stw in the mole catchment reigate stw discharges up to 118 5 megalitres per day into the earlswood brook 16 3947 ref a principal tributary of the earlswood brook is the redhill brook which includes the moors wetland nature reserve within its catchment area from sidlow the mole turns north west towards brockham a number of minor tributaries join the river from the west and are typically horsham and dorking the 18th century weir at betchworth was modified in 2004 to facilitate the installation of two 27 5 kw low head hydro turbines about 90 of the energy generated is fed into the regional electricity grid while the remainder is used to supply the betchworth park estate where the weir is situated the river leaves the wealden clay at brockham passing betchworth castle and flowing briefly across greensand and gault clay to pixham 1kmmi 1 north east of dorking a mean flow of 3 74m3 s cuft s is measured at a fourth gauging station located at castle mill 39 m above od at pixham the mole meets the pipp brook a tributary draining the northeastern slopes of leith hill 16 3965 ref the pipp brook drains the northernmost heavily wooded slopes of leith hill which include squire s great wood and abinger forest as well as areas of wotton westcott and dorking mole gap between dorking and leatherhead the mole cuts a steep sided valley the mole gap though the north downs western flank of box hill and a smaller 50 m cliff at ham bank in norbury park the sudden change from impermeable wealden clay to permeable chalk and the increased gradient of the river which drops 15 m in the six mile 10 km stretch between brockham and leatherhead compared to 3 m in 12 mi between horley and brockham allow the water table to drop below the bed of the river water is able to flow out of the river through swallow holes in the bed and banks decreasing the volume of water carried in the main channel the course of the river through norbury park was partially straightened when the epsom to horsham railway was built in 1837 with the removal of a small meander north of westhumble the meander was reinstated in 1997 in an attempt to enhance this area of the park although it has since become blocked by silt the entirety of the mole gap lies within the surrey hills area of outstanding natural beauty lower mole at leatherhead flow across impermeable london clay winding towards cobham the water table rises at this point and much of the water which drained out of the channel through the chalk returns through springs in the riverbed the aquifer at fetcham is the only one in the entire catchment area the next major tributary the rye which drains ashtead joins to the north of leatherhead before the river is crossed by the m25 motorway at cobham the river swings round in a pronounced axe head meander skirting painshill landscape garden where a 35 ft diameter waterwheel raises water 5 m from the river to feed the ornamental lake in the park 16 3983 ref the undershot wheel at painshill park was restored in 1987 and is located at the end of an artificial leat rather than on the main river channel from painshill park the river flows northeastwards to the thames passing to the west of esher commons and then forming the boundary between hersham and esher where the mean flow of the river is 5 43m3 s cuft s in response september 1968 the river was modified downstream of albany bridge to the thames and new flood defences were constructed finally the mole splits into two branches at the island barn reservoir near molesey the northern and smaller branch continues as the river mole and the southern branch is known as the river ember the two rivers flow either side of the reservoir before running side by side in a north easterly direction merging 400 m before the confluence with the river thames on the reach above teddington lock for the purposes of the remainder of this article the river mole and the river ember are treated as a single entity prior to the last ice age the river thames followed a more northerly route to the north sea from reading via marlow chorleywood st albans hertford and along the present suffolk essex border during this period the mole is thought to have merged with the river wey near byfleet and then flowed in a north easterly direction via richmond to meet the and wey are less than 2km mi apart at their closest point near painshill park during the middle pleistocene period 16 4001 ref the middle pleistocene period was ca 781 000 126 000 years ago a large ice sheet built up across much of the east of england reaching as far south as st albans and chelmsford blocking the path of the proto thames glacial meltwater from the anglian ice sheet caused the thames to divert southwards and flood the valley of the mole wey river thus adopting its present route through london ecology water quality the water quality of the watercourses in the river mole catchment area has improved dramatically since the 1990s in 1990 the environment agency assessed only 23 of the watercourses as grade b good or better but by 2002 60 had reached this standard investment in the sewage treatment works within the catchment area has improved the quality of the discharges into the river and modifications to the runway and apron drainage systems at gatwick airport means that surface water is diverted to aerated pollution released into the river there have been a number of high profile pollution incidents of the river in recent years in 2003 gatwick airport ltd pleaded guilty to charges of allowing chemical pollution to enter the river mole after a detergent used to clean rubber and oil from the runway was washed into crawters brook by airport workers the environment agency estimated that up to 5200 fish of 14 different species were killed as the pollution spread downstream the airport was fined 30 000 by lewes crown court in may 2003 sewage leaking from a pump operated by thames water leaked into the stanford brook killing a number of coarse fish in the gatwick stream biodiversity the marsh frog pelophylax ridibundus a non native species introduced from europe in the 1930s is now commonly found in the upper mole and its tributaries around newdigate and gatwick there is no evidence that the presence of the frogs has had a deleterious effect on indigenous amphibians a second non native species the edible frog to a site at newdigate in the early 1900s it has in 2008 been recorded in tributaries of the river mole at capel and brockham the river mole has the most diverse fish population of any river in england the gatwick

lower mole below dorking since the 1980s in the mole gap between dorking and leatherhead the river supports populations of chub dace barbel brown trout both barbel and brown trout are extremely sensitive to water quality and pollution below leatherhead the river has historically supported larger predatory fish including chub perch pike and eels however in north of esher the old river channel is dominated by floating pennywort a highly invasive weed which cuts off all light to the river bed reducing oxygen levels and resulting in a poor habitat for fish the ember flood relief channel has a diverse fish population including chub dace roach bleak large pike and barbel at the confluence of the mole and the river thames at hampton court palace it is possible to catch a wide variety of coarse fish species the geographical distribution of many species of invertebrate in the river reflects the geology of the catchment area viviparid snails and water scorpions of the genus nepidae are commonly found where the river runs over the london clay crayfish are common in areas associated with high alkalinity particularly around brockham and the tributaries which run over the wealden clay provide an excellent habitat for stoneflies caddisflies fast swimming mayflies and riffle beetles the beautiful demoiselle calopteryx virgo disappeared from the river but has since recolonised the white legged damselfly platycnemis pennipes is also found along the river and the downy emerald cordulia aenea is found between box hill and leatherhead the mole is one of only three locations in england where the river shingle beetle meotica anglica is found a nationally scarce species which is locally common on the river mole is the greater dodder cuscuta europaea conservation the mole catchment area includes twelve sites of special scientific interest sssis which include wetland habitats and the stretch of river through leatherhead has been designated a local nature reserve the mole gap forms part of a special area of conservation and is an sssi of european importance the stretch of river between thorncroft manor 1 km south of leatherhead and river lane in fetcham has been designated a local nature reserve although much of the surrounding land has been taken by residential and commercial development this section of the mole 15 species of dragonfly the geology of the local area is complex since the river leaves the chalk of the mole gap at this point and flows over gravel and clay creating a patchwork of different habitats including scrub woodland hedges banks and meadows as well as the water itself the river also provides a corridor for wildlife through the centre of leatherhead the west end common forms part of the esher commons owned and managed by elmbridge borough council the river mole forms the western boundary of the common flowing past a steep sandy area known locally as the ledges plant species typical of ancient woodland are found in this area including bluebells hyacinthoides non scriptus marsh marigolds caltha palustris and golden saxifrages chrysosplenium sp large bittercress cardamine amara and the non native himalayan balsam impatiens glandulifera are also found along on the west bank of the mole west of the island barn reservoir the heath is an area of rough scrubland and despite its name is a reclaimed landfill site hence its large but artificial mound and small plateau the site is a rich habitat for birds including the redshank and little ringed plover angling below is a list of the coarse fish records for the river mole

the upper mole catchment is dominated by a single broad terrace which runs continuously from the entry to the meath green near horley the terrace corresponds to the flood plain of the river however from this point downstream to brockham the river cuts a narrow trench no more than 150m wide a similar trench is runs up several of the mole s tributaries notably along deanoak brook which follows a local strike the presence of the trench protects the land from flooding rendering it suitable for agriculture mole gap 27 4048 span geology span between dorking and leatherhead the mole cuts a steep sided valley through the north downs creating a 170 m high river cliff on the western flank of box hill the bedrock is permeable chalk and the water table lies permanently below the level of the riverbed allowing water to drain out of the river through swallow holes in the bed and banks the amount of water lost from the river is significant and in very hot summers the channel can become dry between mickleham and thorncroft manor this was recorded most recently in 1949 and 1976 at leatherhead the at this point that the water table rises enough for the water to flow back into the main river channel in a survey in 1958 the geologist c c fagg identified 25 active swallow holes between dorking and mickleham most were only a few centimetres in diameter and were located in the vertical banks of the river below the water line most holes were difficult to observe in times of normal or heavy flow and were susceptible to silting up as new holes were continually being formed a few much larger swallow holes were also observed separated from the main river by a channel of about a metre about six of these larger swallow holes were found to the west of the burford bridge hotel along the course of the a24 mickleham bypass during its construction in 1936 initially the surveyors tried to fill the holes with rubble to prevent the foundations of the new road subsiding however this proved to be impractical and they were instead covered by concrete domes up to 18 m in diameter each fully supported access shaft to allow periodic inspection in the late 1960s the domes were reopened and inspected and the alluvium in the largest swallow hole was observed to have subsided by under the centre of one of the domes when the dorking to leatherhead railway was constructed in 1859 a fossilised swallow hole was discovered in the cutting at the south end of box hill and westhumble railway station suggesting that even in its early history the river had swallow holes the author daniel defoe who attended school in dorking and probably grew up in the village of westhumble described the swallow holes in the river mole in his book a tour thro the whole island of great britain first published in 1724 the current of the river being much obstructed by the interposition of those hills called box hill it forces the waters as it were to find their way through as well as they can and in order to do this beginning i say where the box hill called the stomacher the waters sink insensibly away and in some places are to be seen and i have seen them little channels which go out on the sides of the river where the water in a stream not so big as would fill a pipe of a quarter of an inch diameter trills away out of the river and sinks insensibly into the ground in this manner it goes away lessening the stream for above a mile near two and these they call the swallows not all of the water removed from the river by the swallow holes is returned to the channel at leatherhead the chalk aquifer also feeds the springs at the southern end of fetcham mill pond which have never been known to run dry a survey in march 1883 estimated that the fetcham springs were producing about 3 6 million gallons of water 16 000 m sup 3 sup every day a second survey in 1948 estimated that the same springs were yielding about 5 million gallons day the water table in the chalk of the wey gap is significantly higher than might be expected from natural rainwater percolation alone it has been suggested that a proportion of the excess water originates from the mole gap lower mole 27 4077 span geology span at leatherhead the river leaves the chalk bedrock moving onto london clay the river meanders across an alluvial plain between 400 and 800 m wide towards cobham where it begins to descend to a lower flood plain which in turn broadens to the axehead meander at painshill park at the east end of painshill park the lower flood plain abruptly narrows to form a narrow trench about 60 m wide in which the river runs northwards for 6 5km mi towards hersham where the river enters the flood plain of the river thames there are a series of gravel deposits laid down by the river above the london clay between cobham walton on thames and esher the depth of the deposits generally varies from 2 5mft sigfig 1 to 7mft sigfig 1 and the lower iron oxide whilst the upper layers are loosely packed with angular flints and sand remains of a further gravel terrace containing both cherts and flints to a depth of 4mft sigfig 2 are located along the side of st george s hill history etymology the river is first recorded in the red book of thorney in ad 983 as emen and in the ad 1005 cartulary of the abbey of eynsham as both emen and men variations in the name are recorded throughout the middle ages and the river appears as amele in domesday book and subsequently as emele in 12th and 13th century court rolls this name is probably derived from the old english word men meaning misty or causing mists and the name of the river ember probably has its origins in this name 16 4106 ref the prefix of the referred to as emley bridge in some 19th century records probably also has its origins in the old english word men the name mole does not appear until the 16th century first occurring as moule in harrison s description of britain of 1577 the antiquarian william camden uses the latinized form molis in the 1586 edition of britannia and michael drayton is the first to use mole in his poem poly olbion published in 1613 in john speed s 1611 map of surrey this stretch of the river is denoted by a series of hills accompanied by the legend the river runneth under however the river s name is unlikely to have derived from this behaviour the oxford dictionary of english place names suggests that mole either comes from the latin mola a mill or is a back formation from in john rocque s 1768 map of surrey the name moulsey river is used archaeology in common with much of the rest of the weald the earliest evidence of human settlement along the upper mole is from the mesolithic period 20 000 7000 bc mesolithic sites at wonham flanchford and sidlow finds at wonham include arrowheads and a plano convex knife the lower mole appears to have been settled during the same period and a flint axe dating from mesolithic period found on spit of land close to river mole in cobham in 1965 remains of a flat bottomed dug out canoe were found at the confluence of the mole and thames in 1877 by a local boatman the canoe is preserved at the pitt rivers museum in oxford the mole gap and north downs do not appear to have been settled until the late stone age a large axe typical of a rough out axe produced during the neolithic period which was discovered in 1952 during building work in westhumble at east horsley along with neolithic flakes of flint at fetcham and headley heath significant bronze age finds include a bronze sword found close to the river north of amberley farm near charlwood and a small hoard of weaponry consisting of two palstave axes and a scabbard chape was discovered in 2003 in norbury park close to ham bank navigation it is not clear to what extent the mole was used for navigation in the past in the late 13th century thorncroft manor south of leatherhead purchased a shout a type of boat up to 16 m in length used to carry produce to market and it has been suggested that stone cut from quarries in reigate was transported to london via the river during the 17th century two bills came before parliament to make sections of the river navigable the first in 1663 was passed by the house of commons but was defeated in the house of lords during the following year 1664 an act was passed by from reigate to the river thames but was never executed the only surrey river to have been made fully navigable is the river wey in 1798 william marshall advocated the canalisation of a short stretch of the river mole between betchworth and dorking to facilitate the movement of chalk from quarry to market in 1810 the engineer john rennie proposed a canal linking the river medway to portsmouth which was to have a branch to london following the mole for much of its length between 1825 and 1828 the architect and civil engineer nicholas wilcox cundy proposed a grand imperial ship canal from deptford to chichester passing through the mole gap however he was unable to attract sufficient financial interest in his scheme today the mole is navigable for the 400 m from the confluence with the river thames to molember weir at east molesey where there is a private mooring facility the river may be paddled all year by canoe between brockham and fetcham with an appropriate licence from the british canoe union world war ii defences during the mole were fortified for the defence of london against invasion from the south ghq line b ran along the north downs from farnham and guildford crossing the mole gap to the north of dorking and following the river to horley between betchworth and box hill the north bank of the river mole was stabilised and made steeper to prevent wheeled vehicles from crossing at boxhill farm where access to the river from the north bank was required for the herd of dairy cows a row of twelve concrete cylinders were cast as an anti tank measure gun mounts were also installed to protect both boxhill and deepdene bridges and several pillboxes were installed an anti tank ditch was dug from the stepping stones eastwards across the fields belonging to bradley farm now denbies vineyard the river crossing at sidlow bridge was heavily defended and a line of pill boxes was constructed on the north bank of the river concrete anti tank dragon s teeth were built on both sides of the river a short distance upstream of the bridge the mole mole gap the north downs way crosses the river at box hill via seventeen hexagonal stepping stones which are frequently submerged after heavy rainfall the current stones were dedicated in september 1946 by the then prime minister clement attlee replacing those destroyed during ww2 as an anti invasion measure the location is popular both with anglers and families although swimming is strongly discouraged as the water is polluted in places the stones give their name to the pub in the nearby village of westhumble when the burford bridge was rebuilt in 1937 excavations revealed a flint surfaced approach to a ford at low level having all the signs of roman workmanship suggesting that stane street which ran from london to chichester via dorking crossed the river at this point in defoe s time there was a footbridge at this point but carts and waggons had to cross the river by a ford leatherhead there are three listed bridges in leatherhead of which the 14 arch leatherhead town bridge is the oldest the late middle ages and was rebuilt and enlarged by the county surveyor george gwilt in 1782 83 the bridge is a long structure of 14 segmental arches resting on low piers finished in red brick in flemish bond with some portland stone dressing a few metres downstream of leatherhead bridge stands the grade ii listed railway viaduct which carries the leatherhead to dorking line over the river the bridge was constructed in 1867 and at the insistence of thomas grissell the landowner was given lavish architectural treatment the single span shell bridge stands in the grounds of thorncroft manor to the south of the town centre the bridge was constructed as an ornamental feature in parkland laid out by capability brown in the late 18th century the bridge is largely composed of flint and has a large inverted scallop shell in the place of the keystone and similar shells in the spandrels at each side the bridge was renovated and strengthened in 1999 by a group of canadian engineers working on the terra nove project the restoration project who were billeted in the manor during the second world war cobham a wooden bridge is thought to have existed on the site of cobham bridge since the twelfth century the upkeep of which was the responsibility of the adjacent landowners the present bridge was constructed by george gwilt in 1792 after responsibility for maintenance had been transferred to the county council by act of parliament the bridge has nine low arches and is primarily built of red brick with stone coping the parapets were rebuilt in 1914 and the structure was given a grade ii listing in 1953 watermills domesday book listed twenty mills on the river mole in 1086 upper mole horley mill was first mentioned in a deed of

demolished in 1790 however remains of the mill leat are still visible mention is made of mill race are still visible lower mole slyfield mill near stoke d abernon is first mentioned in domesday book it was used for fulling woollen cloth and milling corn five of the mills mentioned in domesday book were in the borough of elmbridge downside mill cobham was the mill of the manor of downe until the dissolution of the monasteries it was owned by chertsey abbey it has been used for many purposes including the processing of corn paper iron tinplate and flock and the generation of electricity the present building dates from the 18th century but it is inaccessible to the public cobham mill downstream of leatherhead consisted of two mills used for grinding corn in 1953 the larger mill was demolished by surrey county council to allieviate traffic congestion on mill road the remaining red brick mill dates from the 1822 and was in use until 1928 it was restored to full working order by the cobham mill preservation trust and is now open to the public from 2 pm between april and october esher mill was at the end of lower green road where there is now an industrial estate it was used to process corn brass wire iron paper linoleum and books for many years there may have been two mills on the site for corn grinding and industrial use there were a series of fires over a century and after the last in 1978 the buildings were demolished east molesey upper mill was associated with the manor of molesey matham it was used to produce gunpowder from the time of the commonwealth until about 1780 the island where it stood now forms part of the ornamental gardens of a housing development called the wilderness east molesey lower mill also known as sterte mill was associated with the manor of molesey prior during the commonwealth it was used for gunpowder manufacture but after the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 it reverted to corn milling an old timber structure was replaced by a brick building in the 1820s which hampton court way in addition there was ember mill which stood on the banks of the old course of the river ember near hampton court way river ember flood relief channel and confluence with the thames the river mole originally flowed into the river thames at the point where the present hampton court bridge now crosses the thames approximately 500 m upstream of the present confluence on the reach above teddington lock however during the early 1930s when hampton court way and the bridge were built the river mole was redirected to flow into the river ember and both rivers now enter the thames in a single widened and straightened channel once occupied only by the river ember there have been further alterations to the courses of these two rivers in a major flood prevention scheme since serious flooding in the area in 1947 and 1968 literature the river has captured the imagination of several authors and poets particularly since in very hot summers the river channel can become dry between dorking and leatherhead the faerie queene first published in 1590 edmund spenser wrote of the river and mole that like a nousling mole doth make his way still under ground till thamis he overtake in poly olbion first published in 1612 the poet michael drayton described the journey taken by the river thames to the sea as still his goodly traine yet every houre increast and from the surrian shores cleer wey came down to meet his greatnes whom the tames so gratiously doth greet that with the fearne crown d flood he minion like doth play yet is not this the brook entiseth him to stay but as they thus in pompe came sporting on the shole gainst hampton court he meets the soft and gentle mole whose eyes so pierc t his breast that seeming to foreslowe the with trifling up and down he wandreth here and there and that he in her sight transparent might appeare applyes himselfe to fords and setteth his delight on that which might make him gratious in her sight but tames would hardly on oft turning back to show for his much loved mole how loth he was to go the mother of the mole old holmsdale likewise beares th affection of her childe as ill as

certaine hath been affirmed by inhabitants thereabout reporting triall made of it john milton c 15621647 described the river as sullen mole that runneth underneath in a similar vein alexander pope 16881744 wrote in his poem windsor forest first published 1713 and sullen mole that hides his diving flood robert bloomfield 17661823 writes the following lines about the mole valley in his 1806 poem wild flowers thy balm that softens human ills come on the long drawn clouds that fling their shadows o er the surry hills yon green topt hills and far away where late as now i freedom stole and spent one dear delicious day on thy wild banks romantic mole ay there s the scene beyond the sweep of london s congregated cloud the dark brow d wood the headlong steep and valley paths without a crowd here thames i watch thy flowing tides thy thousand sails am proud to see but where the mole all silent glides dwells peace and peace is wealth to me extract from the river mole or emlyn stream by mary uniacke writing under her maiden name mary drinkwater bethune which was published in 1839 who may count back that forgotten time when first the waters forced an outlet here when the foundations of these stedfast hills were shaken and that awful day yet leaves its trace the waters find their way now laughing in the sun now swallowed up in caverns pervious to their course alone they leave their channel dry and hide awhile their silent flow like bitter tears unshed from the dim eye before a careless world unheeding of our grief but swelling still in the full heart which leaves unsoothed unseen and broods o er ruined hopes and days gone by tributaries the major tributaries of the river mole are the ifield brook gatwick stream earlswood brook pipp brook and the rye which drains ashtead a full list of the tributaries is given in the table below distributary river ember the beggar s opera is a ballad opera in three acts written in 1728 by john gay with music arranged by johann christoph pepusch it is one of the watershed plays in augustan drama and is the only example of the once thriving genre of satirical ballad opera to remain popular today ballad operas were satiric musical plays that used some of the conventions of opera but without recitative the lyrics of the airs in the piece are set to popular broadsheet ballads opera arias church hymns and folk tunes of the time the beggar s opera premiered at the lincoln s inn fields theatre on 29 january 1728 and ran for 62 consecutive performances the longest run in theatre history up to that time after 146 performances of rober cambert s pomone in 1671 the work became gay s greatest success and has been played ever since in 1920 the beggar s opera began an astonishing revival run of 1 463 performances at one of the longest runs in history for any piece of musical theatre at that time the piece satirised italian opera which had become popular in london according to the new york times gay wrote the work more as an anti opera than an opera one of its attractions to its 18th century london public being its lampooning of the italian opera style and the english public s fascination with it instead of the grand music and themes of opera the work uses familiar tunes and characters that were ordinary people some of the songs were by opera composers like handel but only the most popular of these were used the audience could hum along with the music and identify with the characters the story satirised politics poverty and injustice focusing on the theme of corruption at all levels of society lavinia fenton the first polly peachum became an overnight success her pictures were in great demand verses were written to her and books published about her after appearing in the beggars opera she ran away with her married lover charles powlett 3rd duke of bolton bertolt brecht and kurt weill adapted the opera into die dreigroschenoper the threepenny opera in 1928 sticking close to the original plot and characters but with a new libretto and mostly new music origin and analysis the original idea of the opera came from jonathan swift who wrote to alexander pope on 30 august 1716 asking what think you of a newgate pastoral among the thieves and whores there their friend gay decided that it would be a satire rather than a pastoral opera for his original production in 1728 gay intended all the songs to be sung without any accompaniment adding to the shocking and gritty atmosphere of his conception however a week or so before the opening night john rich the theatre director insisted on having johann christoph pepusch a composer associated with his theatre write songs in the opera including a fugue based on lucy s 3rd act song i m like a skiff on the ocean toss d and also to arrange the 69 songs although there is no external evidence of who the arranger was inspection of the original 1729 score formally published by dover books demonstrates that pepusch was the arranger the work took satiric aim at the passionate interest of the upper classes in italian opera and simultaneously set out to lampoon the notable british whig party gay used scottish folk melodies mostly taken from the poet allan ramsay s hugely popular collection the gentle shepherd 1725 plus two french tunes including the carol bergers ecoutez la musique for his song fill every glass to serve his hilariously pointed and irreverent texts the renowned composer john christopher pepusch composed an ouverture and arranged all the tunes shortly before the opening night at lincoln s inn fields on 28 january 1728 however all that remains instrumentation and the melodies of the songs with unfigured basses various reconstructions have been attempted and a 1990 reconstruction of the score by american composer jonathan dobin has been used in a number of modern productions gay uses the operatic norm of three acts as opposed to the standard in spoken drama of the time of five acts and tightly controls the dialogue and plot so that there are surprises in each of the forty five fast paced scenes and 69 short songs the success of the opera was accompanied by a public desire for keepsakes and mementos ranging from images of polly on fans and clothing playing cards and fire screens broadsides featuring all the characters and the rapidly published musical score of the opera the play is sometimes seen to be a reactionary call for libertarian values in response to the growing power of the conservative whig party it may also have been influenced by the then popular ideology of locke that men should be allowed their natural liberties these democratic strains of thought influenced the populist movements s opera was a part the character of macheath has been considered by critics as both a hero and an anti hero harold gene moss arguing that macheath is a noble character has written one whose drives are toward love and the vital passions macheath becomes an almost christ like victim of the decadence surrounding him contrarily john richardson in the peer reviewed journal eighteenth century life has argued that macheath is powerful as a literary figure precisely because he stands against any interpretation against expectation and illusion the beggar s opera has had an influence on all later british stage comedies especially on nineteenth century british comic opera and the modern musical adaptations as was typical practice of the time in london a commemorative score of the entire opera was assembled and published quickly as was common this consisted of the fully arranged overture followed by the melodies of the 69 songs supported by only the simplest bass accompaniments there are no indications of dance in three instances lucy s is then his fate decree d sir one measure of descending scale marked viol trape s in the days of my youth in which the fa la la chorus is written as viol and the final reprieve dance macheath s thus i stand like a turk which includes two sections of 16 measures of dance marked viol see the 1729 score formerly published by dover the absence of the original performing parts has allowed producers and arrangers free rein the tradition of personalised arrangements dating back at least as far as thomas arne s later 18th century arrangements continues today running the gamut of musical styles from romantic to baroque austin britten sargent bonynge dobin and other conductors have each imbued the songs with a personal stamp highlighting different aspects of characterisation following is a list of some of the most highly regarded

sinclair as lucy in 1928 on the 200th anniversary of the original production bertolt brecht words and kurt weill music created a popular new musical adaptation of the work in germany entitled die dreigroschenoper the threepenny opera in this work the original plot is followed fairly closely although the time is brought forward over a hundred years but the music is almost all new in 1946 john la touche book and lyrics and duke ellington music created another musical adaptation of the work for broadway entitled beggar s holiday an updated rendition of the story focused on a corrupt world inhabited by rakish mobsters raffish madams and their dissolute benjamin britten created an adaptation with new harmonisations and arrangements of pre existing tunes additional dialogue was written by

protesting at gay s work as libellous and ironically assisting him in satirising the walpole establishment by taking the government s side it will i know be said by these libertine stage players that the satire is general and that it discovers a consciousness of guilt for any particular man to apply it to himself but they seem to forget that there are such things as innuendo s a never failing

tour de la question spirituals or negro spirituals are religious generally christian songs that were created by enslaved african people in the united states terminology and origin the term spiritual is derived from spiritual song the king james bible s translation of ephesians 5 19 says speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the lord the term spiritual song was often used in the black and white christian community through the 19th century and indeed much earlier and spiritual was used as a noun to mean according to the context spiritual person or spiritual thing but not specifically with regard to song negro spiritual first appears in print in the 1860s where slaves are described as using spirituals for religious songs sung sitting or standing in place and spiritual shouts for more dance like music musicologist george pullen jackson extended the term folk hymnody as in his 1938 book white spirituals in the southern uplands but this does not appear to have been widespread usage previously the term however has often been broadened to include subsequent arrangements into more standard european american hymnodic styles and to include post emancipation songs with stylistic similarities to the original negro spirituals although numerous rhythmical and sonic elements of negro spirituals can be traced to african sources negro spirituals are a musical form that is indigenous and specific to the religious experience in the united states of africans and their descendants they are a result of the interaction of music and religion from africa with music and religion of european origin further this interaction occurred only in the united states africans who converted to christianity in other parts of the world even in the caribbean and latin america did not evolve this form there is also a duality in the lyrics of spirituals they communicated many christian ideals while also communicating the hardship that was a result of being to the composer s life it was a way of sharing religious emotional and physical experience through song alternative interpretations some scholarship claims that songs such as wade in the water contained explicit instructions to fugitive slaves on how to avoid capture and on which routes to take to successfully make their way to freedom wade in the water allegedly recommends leaving dry land and taking to the water as a strategy to throw pursuing bloodhounds off one s trail the gospel train song of the free and swing low sweet chariot are likewise supposed to contain veiled references to the underground railroad and many sources assert that follow the drinking gourd contained a coded map to the underground railroad the authenticity of such claims has been challenged as speculative and critics like james kelley have pointed to the apparent lack of primary source material in support of them noted african american literary critic sterling allen brown who had interviewed former slaves and their children was firm in his assertion in a some scholars who have found parallels between the words of negro and white spirituals would have us believe that when the negro sang of freedom he meant only what the whites meant namely freedom from sin free individualistic whites on the make in a prospering civilization nursing the american dream could well have felt their only bondage to be that of sin and freedom to be religious salvation but with the drudgery the hardships the auction block the slave mart the shackles and the lash so literally present in the negro s experience it is hard to imagine why for the negro they would remain figurative the scholars certainly do not make it clear but rather take refuge in such dicta as the slave did not contemplate his low condition are we to believe that the slave singing i been rebuked i been scorned done had a hard time sho s you bawn referred to his being outside of the true religion ex slaves of course inform us differently sin dear as that freedom was to the true believer but from physical bondage those attacking slavery as such had to be as rare as anti hitler marching songs in occupied france but there were oblique references frederick douglass has told us of the double talk of the spirituals canaan for instance stood for canada and over and beyond hidden satire the songs also were grapevines for communications harriet tubman herself called the moses of her people has told us that go down moses was tabu in the slave states but the people sang it nonetheless collections jubilee singers of fisk university in the 1850s reverend alexander reid superintendent of the spencer academy in the old choctaw nation hired some enslaved africans from the choctaws for some work around the school he heard two of them uncle wallace and aunt minerva willis singing religious songs that they had apparently composed among these were swing low sweet chariot steal away to jesus the angels are jordan roll later reid who left indian territory at the beginning of the civil war attended a musical program put on by a group of negro singers from fisk university they were singing mostly popular music of the day and reid thought the songs he remembered from his time in the choctaw nation would be at least as appropriate he and his wife transcribed the songs of the willises as they remembered them and sent them to fisk university the jubilee singers put on their first performance singing the old captives songs at a religious conference in 1871 the songs were first published in 1872 in a book entitled jubilee songs as sung by the jubilee singers of fisk university by theodore f seward wallace willis died in 1883 or 1884 over time the pieces the jubilee singers performed came to be arranged and performed by trained musicians in 1873 mark twain whose father had owned slaves found fisk singing to be in the genuine old way he in the peoria journal said they have lost the wild rhythms the barbaric melody the passion they smack of the north some fifty years later zora neale hurston in her 1938 book the sanctified church criticized fisk singers and similar groups at tuskegee and hampton as using a glee club style that was full of musicians tricks not to be found in the original negro spirituals urging readers to visit an unfashionable negro church to experience real negro spirituals other collections a second important early collection of lyrics is slave songs of the united states by william francis allen charles pickard ware and lucy mckim garrison 1867 a group of lyrics to negro spirituals was published by colonel thomas wentworth higginson who commanded a regiment of former slaves during the civil war in an article in the atlantic monthly and subsequently included in his 1869 memoir army life in a black regiment century saw a resurgence of the spiritual this trend was impacted strongly by composers and musical

after the fight in 1987 leonard came back again and fought hagler for the middleweight championship leonard a huge underdog defeated hagler by a twelve round split decision the following month leonard retired again hearns knocked out juan roldan in four rounds in late 1987 to win the vacant wbc middleweight title becoming the first boxer to win world titles in four weight divisions hearns lost knockout against iran barkley hearns returned to win the inaugural wbo super middleweight title against james kinchen by a majority decision on 4 november 1988 to become the first boxer to win world

brabant adeliza of louvain sometimes known in england as adelicia of louvain also called adela and aleidis c 1103 23 april 1151 was queen of england from 1121 to 1135 as the second wife of king henry i she was the daughter of godfrey i count of louvain early life and family adeliza of louvain was born in 1105 in louvain present day belgium she was renowned for her beauty reflected in the epithet the fair maiden of brabant the chronicler henry of huntingdon also mentions adelizas beauty in an interlude in his historia anglorum stating a jewel grows pale on you a crown does not shine put adornment aside for nature provides your adornment her father was godfrey i count of louvain 1095 1139 landgrave of brabant and duke of lower lotharingia 1106 1128 an ally of henry v holy roman emperor after the death of adelizas mother ida of chiny godfrey married clementia of flanders who had fought with the french against the normans in 1118 adeliza s brother joscelin of louvain married the heiress to the percy fortune he is often referred to as an opportunist queenship plans for adelizas marriage to henry i of england may have begun when she was as young as sixteen even before henrys only legitimate son william adelin died on 25 november 1120 in the white ship disaster however henrys need for a new male heir expedited the marriage plans and the couple wed on 24 january 1121 apparently in addition to her beauty henry was also attracted to adeliza as a wife because she was a descendant of charlemagne it is thought that henrys only surviving legitimate child empress matilda from his first wife matilda of scotland may have been involved in arranging his second marriage due to the fact that she was with him near the time that it was being negotiated henry of huntingdon mentions the royal couple in his historia anglorum stating that the appears to have traveled extensively with henry likely to increase the chances of her conception despite their close contact however adeliza and henry never produced a child unlike henrys first wife matilda adeliza appears to have played a very passive role in the administration of the kingdom while matilda issued some thirty one charters and writs during her queenship during adeliza s fifteen year marriage to henry i she issued one and she only attested 13 of henrys many charters even though they were almost always together role as artistic patron despite her limited involvement in politics adeliza seems to have played an active role as a patron of the arts and literature and was influential in fostering the rise of french poetry in the english court while english queens had been traditionally associated with artistic patronage for decades and a number of them including edith of wessex emma of normandy and matilda had financed a number of works in different media adeliza primarily sponsored books written in french at the extremely popular a trend given impetus by wealthy aristocratic women like adeliza philippe de thaon an anglo norman poet dedicated his zoological treatise known as the bestiary to the queen poem philippe de thaon has distilled into a french treatise the bestiary a book in latin for the honour of a jewel who is an outstandingly beautiful woman and she is courtly and wise of good customs and generous she is called aaliz queen is she crowned she is the queen of england may her soul never know trouble listen to what we nd about her name in hebrew aaliz is her name praise of god is in hebrew truly aaliz laus of god i do not dare give further praise lest envy take me but so that she may i wish to compose this book may god be present at its beginning poem the bestiary would have been amply illustrated and was intended to be read page by page not all at once like a poem many other works that adeliza commissioned were similar in structure to the bestiary including the now lost life of king henry by david widowhood and remarriage when henry died on 1 december 1135 adeliza retired temporarily to the benedictine convent of wilton abbey near salisbury she was present at the dedication of henry s tomb at reading abbey on the first anniversary of his death at about that time she founded a leper hospital dedicated to saint giles at fugglestone st peter wiltshire in 1138 three years after henry i s death adeliza married william d aubigny 1st earl of arundel one of henry i s advisors and son of guillaume daubigny and maud le bigod together they lived at her castle of arundel on the sussex coast order of birth alice william olivia reynor geoffrey henry and agatha relationship with matilda although not a great deal is known about adelizas relationship with her stepdaughter it is known she was present at the ceremony when henry officially named matilda as his heir since the chronicler john of worcester states that the queen swore an oath for the kings daughter after her second marriage adeliza received matilda at her home in arundel along with matildas half brother robert 1st earl of gloucester in defiance of the wishes of her husband who was a staunch supporter of king stephen she later betrayed them and handed them over when king stephen besieged the castle trying to explain adeliza s actions john of worcester suggests that she feared the kings majesty and worried that she might lose the great estate she held throughout england he also mentions adelizas excuse to king stephen she swore on oath that his enemies had not come to england on her account but that she had close to her landholdings because of henry is generosity adeliza was given the revenues of rutland shropshire and a large district of london with possession of the city of chichester henry also gave the manor of aston to adeliza as his queen and wife landholdings that were part of adeliza of louvains dower include waltham in essex an estate in south east england with areas in hertfordshire and bedfordshire buckinghamshire berkshire and middlesex she had property in devon as a gift from henry i she was given a property in ashleworth a component of the royal estate of berkeley in 1126 the whole county of shropshire was given to her even though it is not listed in the pipe roll adeliza gave her brother joscelin a large estate in sussex called petworth that was dependent on her castle of arundel henry also gave adeliza lands that had previously been matildas including waltham and queenhithe she had estates in essex hertfordshire bedfordshire middlesex gloucestershire and devon lands in additions to those gifts she was given a portion of the royal estate at berkeley and the county of shropshire after matilda died adeliza continued to exercise jurisdiction over her lands retaining some of her property until 1150 in 1136 she endowed reading abbey with one hundred shillings a year from the revenues of queenhithe on the first anniversary of henry is death adeliza give the manor of aston to the abbey of reading and endowed them with lands to provide for the convent and other religious pweaona sic coming to the abbey on the occasion of the anniversary of my lord king henry she added the gift of a church a few years later later years in the last years of her life adeliza appears to have faded into obscurity in 1150 adeliza left william to enter the monastery of afflighem in flanders at least one of her brothers was also living at this monastery the annals at the monastery are the only source to mention her death some traditions imply she was buried at the monastery but a donation made by her brother joscelin to reading abbey seems

gravel plains of the kennet valley north of basingstoke and south of reading it is situated within pamber civil parish and backs on to pamber forest a 500acre km2 sssi and remnant of the much larger ancient royal forest of pamber it is recorded as having been established for at least 400 years history until the mid 19th century the village was a local centre for brick making the local clays being recognised as particularly good since the roman period examples of clay roof tiles produced in this area for the nearby roman town of calleva atrebatum near modern silchester can be seen at reading museum a major part of the village was confiscated from the engelfield family and given to the benyon family during the late tudor period other parts were gifted in payment to the queen s college oxford it is assumed that this was in return for education although it may not have been this legacy and houses in the area the village has grown organically from a few houses being effectively one street with no social centre current local planning policy has successfully prevented any inappropriate development of additional housing in the area current population is of only a few hundred it is a desirable location resulting in upper quartile house prices typical of rural hampshire the village has one pub the plough which maintains a very traditional english pub environment little london is a common village name in england assumed by some to have its origins in the quantity of seasonal londoners who would camp for the harvest season however in common with many little londons approximately 50 mi or so from london it has also been claimed that the name was given by settlers escaping the great plague of london of 1665 alternatively it could have been corrupted from little loddon the name of a stream that marks the southern extent of the village little london at tadley would second half of the 16th century it was on a main drovers route into london like that at oakley in buckinghamshire there have been at least 70 communities established in england and wales many of which still exist they were temporary homes for the long distance drovers moving their cattle to london and the great fairs and markets of england tadley was on the route to the fairs of blackbush farnham croydon and kingston and london s smithfield market the sites were established on common land away from other communities the drovers had a licence to travel granted by elizabeth 1st and were regarded as foreigners by the local parishioners who could not travel without a settlement

was a german astronomer among his activities he worked on the calculation of the periods of comets and asteroids measured the distance from the earth to the sun and made observations of the planet saturn biography encke was born in hamburg where his father was a clergyman at the jakobskirche he was the youngest of eight children when his father died when he was four the family in straitened circumstances thanks to the financial assistance of a teacher he was able to be educated at the gelehrtenschule des johanneums he studied mathematics and astronomy from 1811 at the university of gttingen under carl friedrich gauss but he enlisted in the hanseatic legion for the campaign of 18131814 serving as a sergeant in the artillery of the prussian army in holstein and mecklenburg in 1814 he resumed his studies at the university but after napoleon s escape from elba he returned to the become a lieutenant having returned to gttingen in 1816 he was at once appointed by bernhardt von lindenau as his assistant in the observatory of seeberg near gotha he had become acquainted with von lindenau during his military service there he completed his investigation of the comet of 1680 for which the cotta prize was awarded to him in 1817 by judges gauss and olbers he correctly assigned a period of 71 years to the comet of 1812 that comet is now called 12p pons brooks following a suggestion by jean louis pons who suspected one of the three comets discovered in 1818 to be the same one already discovered by him in 1805 encke began to calculate the orbital elements of this comet at this time all the known comets had an orbital period of seventy years and more with an aphelion far beyond the orbit of uranus the most famous comet of this family was comet halley with its period of seventy six years so the orbit of the comet discovered by pons have a period of 3 3 years so that the aphelion had to be within the orbit of jupiter encke predicted its return for 1822 but this return was observable only from the southern hemisphere and was seen by carl ludwig christian rmker in australia the comet was also identified with the one seen by pierre mchain in 1786 and by caroline herschel in 1795 encke sent his calculations as a note to gauss olbers and bessel his former mathematics professor published this note and encke became famous as the discoverer of the short periodic comets the first object of this family the encke comet was named after him and so it is one of the few comets not named after the discoverer but after the one who calculated the orbit later this comet was identified as the origin of the taurids meteor showers the importance of the predicted return based on the calculation by encke was rewarded by the royal astronomical society in london by presenting their gold medal to him in 1824 in this year author bookseller and publisher rudolph zacharias becker the publisher of works from the seeberg observatory they had three sons and two daughters in 1825 he was elected a fellow of the royal society eight masterly treatises on the comet s movements were published by him in the berliner abhandlungen 18291859 from a fresh discussion of the transits of venus in 1761 and 1769 he deduced a solar parallax of 8 57 arcsecond this and the corresponding distance to the sun were long accepted as authoritative his results were published in two separate tracts entitled die entfernung der sonne the distance to the sun 1822 1824 in 1822 he became director of the seeberg observatory and in 1825 was promoted to a corresponding position at berlin where a new observatory built under his superintendence and with the support of alexander von humboldt and king frederick william iii of prussia was inaugurated in 1835 mostly on the recommendation of bessel encke became director of the new directed the preparation of the star maps of the academy 18301859 beginning in 1830 he edited and greatly improved the astronomisches jahrbuch and he issued four volumes of the astronomische beobachtungen auf der sternwarte zu berlin observations of the berlin observatory 18401857 within the following time encke was involved in the discovery and orbital parameter determination of other short periodic comets and asteroids in 1837 encke described a broad variation in the brightness of the a ring of saturn the encke gap was later named in honor of his observations of saturn s rings in 1844 encke became professor for astronomy at the university of berlin much labor was bestowed by him upon facilitating the computation of the movements of the asteroids with this end in view he expounded to the berlin academy in 1849 a mode of determining an elliptic orbit from three observations and communicated to that body in 1851 a new method of calculating planetary perturbations by means of rectangular coordinates republished no 141 1903 encke visited england in 1840 he was elected a foreign member of the royal swedish academy of sciences in 1836 incipient brain disease compelled him to withdraw from official life in november 1863 he still was director of the berlin observatory until his death on 26 august 1865 in spandau his successor was wilhelm julius foerster he contributed extensively to the periodical literature of astronomy encke s grave is preserved at a cemetery in the kreuzberg section of berlin the friedhof ii der

unknown anna hammar rosn swedish publisher born 1735 a national monument in the united states is a protected area that is similar to a national park except that the president of the united states can declare an area of the united states to be a national monument without the approval of congress however areas within and extending beyond national parks monuments and national forests can be part of wilderness areas which have an even greater degree of protection than a national park would alone although wilderness areas managed by the united states forest service and bureau of land management often allow hunting and grazing national monuments can be managed by one of several federal agencies the national park service united states forest service united states fish and wildlife service or bureau of land management historically some national monuments were managed by the u s war department national monuments can be so designated through the power of the antiquities act of 1906 president theodore roosevelt used the act to declare devils tower national monument history the antiquities act of 1906 resulted from states the reference in the act to objects of scientific interest enabled president theodore roosevelt to make a natural geology in 1908 roosevelt used the act to proclaim more than of the grand canyon as a national monument in 1918 president woodrow wilson proclaimed katmai national monument in alaska comprising more than 1000000acrekm2 lk in katmai was later enlarged to nearly 2800000acrekm2 lk in by subsequent antiquities act proclamations and for many years was the largest national park system unit petrified forest grand canyon and katmai were among the many national monuments later converted to national parks by congress in response to roosevelt s declaration of the grand canyon monument a putative mining claimant sued in federal court claiming that roosevelt had overstepped the antiquities act authority by protecting an entire canyon in 1920 the united states supreme court ruled unanimously that the grand canyon was indeed an object of historic or scientific interest and could be protected by proclamation setting a precedent for the use of the antiquities act to preserve large areas federal courts have antiquities act preservation authority substantial opposition did not materialize until 1943 when president franklin delano roosevelt in 1949 for example president harry s truman proclaimed effigy mounds national monument to accept a donation of the land from the state of iowa at the request of iowa s delegation the most substantial use of the proclamation authority came in 1978 when president jimmy carter proclaimed 15 new national monuments in alaska after congress had adjourned without passing a major alaska lands bill strongly opposed in that state congress passed a revised version of the bill in 1980 incorporating most of these national monuments into national parks and preserves but the act also curtailed further use of the proclamation authority in alaska the proclamation authority was not used again anywhere until 1996 when president bill clinton proclaimed the grand staircase escalante national monument in utah this action was widely unpopular in utah and bills were introduced to further restrict the president s authority to date none of them have been enacted most of the 16 national monuments created service but by the bureau of land management as part of the national landscape conservation system new monuments managed by the park service are governors island national monument virgin islands coral reef national monument and formerly minidoka internment national monument since 2008 minidoka national historic site george w bush proclaimed two very different monuments in 2006 the hundredth

lk in of the pacific ocean larger than all of america s national parks combined it was renamed papahnaumokukea marine national monument in 2007 presidents have used the antiquities act s proclamation authority not only to create new national monuments but to enlarge existing ones for example franklin d roosevelt significantly enlarged dinosaur national monument in 1938 lyndon b johnson added ellis island to statue of liberty national monument in 1965 and jimmy carter made major additions to glacier bay national bush used the antiquities act to create the mariana trench marine national monument

oils it has high levels of the omega 3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid epa and docosahexaenoic acid dha cod liver oil also contains vitamin a and vitamin d it has historically been taken because of its vitamin a and vitamin d content it was once commonly given to children because vitamin d has been shown to prevent rickets and other symptoms of vitamin d deficiency manufacture cod liver oil was traditionally manufactured by filling a wooden barrel with fresh cod livers and seawater and allowing the mixture to ferment for up to a year before removing the oil modern cod liver oil is made by cooking the whole cod body tissues of fatty fish during the manufacture of fish meal therapeutic uses cod liver oil is widely taken to ease the pain and joint stiffness associated with arthritis the recommended dietary allowance of vitamin a is 900 g per day for adult men and 15 g per day the tolerable upper intake levels are 3000 g day and 100 g day respectively so people consuming cod liver oil as a source of omega 3 fatty acids should pay attention to how much vitamin a and vitamin d this adds to their diet a 300 mg soft gelatin capsule like those made by brands like seven seas and seacod by sanofi contain approximately 88 g vitamin a per dose cod liver oil may be an effective complementary measure for long term treatment of multiple sclerosis use of cod liver oil during pregnancy is associated with lower risk of type i diabetes in the offspring although see adverse effects below this effect was found only in mothers taking cod liver oil not in mothers taking multivitamin supplements cod liver oil taken by nursing mothers improves the breast milk by increasing the amount of fatty acids which promotes brain development and the amount of vitamin a which helps prevent infections but the level of vitamin d is unchanged a norwegian study of more than 68 000 women oil supplements had significantly reduced mortality 25 for all cancers 45 for lung cancer compared to women who did not take such supplements vitamin a accumulates in the liver and can reach harmful levels sufficient to cause hypervitaminosis a pregnant women may want to consider consulting a doctor when taking cod liver oil because of the high amount of natural forms of vitamin a such as retinol high doses of synthetic vitamin a retinoids have been shown to cause birth defects a toxic dose of retinol vitamin a is around 25 000 iu kg see retinol retinoid overdose toxicity or the equivalent of about 1 25 kg of cod liver oil for a 50 kg person there is an increased risk of prostate cancer in men taking supplements with high levels of omega 3 fatty acids including cod liver oil the risks of hypervitaminosis and of exposure to environmental toxins such as mercury polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs dioxins and other contaminants are reduced when purification processes are applied to produce refined fatty acids such as epa and dha a high intake of cod liver oil by pregnant women is associated with a nearly fivefold increased risk of gestational hypertension other uses in newfoundland cod liver oil was sometimes used as the liquid base for traditional red ochre paint the coating of choice for use on outbuildings and work buildings associated with the cod fishery in tbingen germany cod liver oil is used as the punishment for the loser at the traditional de stocherkahnrennen a

island kingdom and fooled a british town for some months biography on 3 april 1817 a cobbler in almondsbury in gloucestershire england met an apparently disoriented young woman wearing exotic clothes who was speaking an incomprehensible language the cobbler s wife took this stranger to the overseer of the poor who placed her in the hands of the local county magistrate samuel worrall who lived in on the estate where tower house is located worrall and his american born wife elizabeth could not understand her either what they did determine was that she called herself caraboo and that she was interested in chinese imagery they sent her to the local inn where she identified a drawing of a pineapple with the word ananas meaning pineapple in many indo european languages and insisted on sleeping on the floor samuel worrall bristol and tried for vagrancy during her imprisonment a portuguese sailor named manuel eynesso or enes said he spoke her language and translated her story according to enes she was princess caraboo from the island of javasu in the indian ocean she had been captured by pirates and after a long voyage she had jumped overboard in the bristol channel and swam ashore the worralls brought caraboo to their home for ten weeks this representative of exotic royalty was a favourite of the local dignitaries she used a bow and arrow fenced swam naked and prayed to a god whom she named alla tallah she acquired exotic clothing and her portrait was painted and reproduced in local newspapers her authenticity was attested to by a dr wilkinson who identified her language using edmund fry s pantographia and stated that marks on the back of her head were the work of oriental surgeons eventually the truth surfaced a boarding house keeper mrs neale recognised her from the picture in hosts this would be princess was in truth a cobbler s daughter mary baker ne willcocks from witheridge devon she had been a servant girl around england but had found no place to stay she invented her fictitious language from imaginary and gypsy words and created an exotic character and story the odd marks on her head were scars from a crude cupping operation in a poorhouse hospital in london the british press had a field day at the expense of the duped rustic middle class her hosts arranged for her to travel to philadelphia and she departed 28 june 1817 on 13 september 1817 a letter was printed in the bristol journal allegedly from sir hudson lowe the official in charge of the exiled emperor napoleon on st helena it claimed that after the philadelphia bound ship bearing the beautiful caraboo had been driven close to the island by a tempest the intrepid princess impulsively cut herself adrift in a small boat rowed ashore and so fascinated the emperor that he was applying that story is unverified in the usa she briefly continued her role appearing on stage at the washington hall philadelphia as princess caraboo with little success her last contact with the worralls was in a letter from new york in november 1817 in which she complained of her notoriety she appears to have returned to philadelphia until she left america in 1824 returning to england in 1824 she returned to britain and exhibited herself for a short time in new bond street london as princess caraboo but her act was not successful she may have briefly travelled to france and spain in her guise but soon returned to england in september 1828 she was living as a widow in bedminster under the name mary burgess in reality the name of a cousin there she married richard baker and gave birth to a daughter the following year in 1839 she was selling leeches to the bristol infirmary hospital she died on 24 december 1864 and film the hoax provided material for a script

boy a minor hit for ringo starr in 1978 her composition oriental swing was sampled heavily to create parov stelar s 2012 retro song booty swing which in turn gained notoriety when it was used in a 2013 chevrolet commercial background she was born as lillian hardin in memphis tennessee where she grew up in a household with her grandmother priscilla martin a former slave from near oxford mississippi during her early years hardin was taught hymns drawn to popular music and later blues but could only listen to or play these styles occasionally and covertly because her mother dempsey lil called her decie a deeply religious woman considered them sinful early education and mentors hardin first received piano instruction from her third grade teacher miss violet white then her mother enrolled her in mrs hook s school of music i later learned that they had taught me all the wrong things hardin recalled in 1971 but they meant well it was at fisk university a college for african americans located in downtown nashville that hardin was taught a more acceptable approach to the instrument hardin stayed at the school for one year returning to memphis in 1917 in august 1918 she moved to chicago with her mother and stepfather by then she had become proficient in reading music a skill that landed her a job as a sheet music demonstrator at jones music store the proprietor jennie jones also performers to the store a visit by jelly roll morton would profoundly affect hardin s musical education he sat down she wrote in her unpublished biography the piano rocked the floor shivered the people swayed while he attacked the keyboard with his long skinny fingers beating out a double rhythm with his feet on the loud pedal oh was i thrilled and amazed he finally got up from the piano grinned and looked at me as if to say let this be a lesson to you well it was a lesson when a small crowd urged hardin to play something for morton she did i laid witches dance and rachmaninoff s prelude in c sharp minor on him morton s visit had a profound effect on hardin who began embellishing the sheet music with her own ideas much to the delight of customers she had been on the job for three weeks when clarinetist lawrence duh s new orleans creole jazz band came in for an audition jones hardin there when duh was asked to add a pianist i did my best to be a miniature jelly roll morton she said and duh decided to keep me the store had been paying hardin 3 a week but duh offered 22 50 knowing that her mother would not approve of her working in a cabaret she made it known that her new job was playing for a dancing school three weeks later the band moved on to a better booking at the de luxe caf where the entertainers included florence mills and cora green from there the band moved up to the jewel of chicago s night life the dreamland here the principal entertainers were alberta hunter and ollie powers and there was no finer night spot in chicago when king oliver s creole jazz band replaced duh s group at the dreamland oliver asked hardin to stay with him she was with oliver at the dreamland in 1921 when an offer came for the orchestra to play a six month engagement at that booking hardin returned to chicago while the rest of the oliver band went on to los angeles marriages and divorces in chicago hardin went back to work at the dreamland as pianist in an orchestra for mae brady a violinist and vaudeville stalwart while there she fell for jimmie johnson a young singer from washington d c whom she married on august 22 1922 the marriage was short lived ending in divorce in the meantime the oliver band returned from california and opened at the royal gardens with bertha gonzales at the piano but soon found itself back at the dreamland with hardin at the piano his band was enjoying enormous success at the dreamland when king oliver sent for louis armstrong to join as second cornetist armstrong was beginning to make a name for himself in their hometown new orleans and regarded oliver papa joe as his mentor some say that oliver saw louis as a threat to his jazz throne and decided that containment although by all accounts both cornetists enjoyed working together at first hardin was unimpressed with louis who arrived in chicago wearing clothes and a hair style that she deemed to be too country for chicago but she worked to take the country out of him and a romance developed to the surprise of other band members some of whom had been trying to woo pretty hardin for some time with no success she already had divorce experience and helped louis get a divorce from his first wife daisy from whom he had separated back in new orleans hardin and louis were married on february 4 1924 hardin took louis shopping and taught him how to dress more fashionablyshe also got rid of his bangs and began working on his career recognizing his extraordinary talent she felt that he was wasting it in a secondary role louis was happy to be playing next to his idol but hardin eventually persuaded him to leave oliver and go it on his own armstrong eventually accepted a job with fletcher henderson in new york city hardin stayed in chicago first with oliver then leading a band of her own when hardin s band got a job at the dreamland caf in chicago the following year she prepared for louis return to chicago by having a huge banner made to advertise him as the world s greatest trumpet player louis was gaining an impressive reputation when richard m jones convinced okeh records to make a series of sessions under his name the classic armstrong hot five recordings with hardin at the piano kid ory on trombone johnny dodds on clarinet and johnny st cyr on banjo this stellar group rehearsed at louis and hardin s residence on chicago s east 41st street and held its first session on november 15 1925 few recordings are as celebrated as the ones made by the hot five and sometimes with earl hines replacing hardin the hot seven between then and the end of 1928 hardin had actually in april and may 1926 she also recorded a session for columbia records as the new orleans wanderers in the late 1920s hardin and louis grew apart armstrong formed a new hot five with earl hines on piano hardin reformed her own band with freddie keppard on cornet whom hardin considered second only to louis louis and hardin separated in 1931 when he had begun a liaison with alpha smith who threatened to sue armstrong for breach of promise so he begged hardin not to grant him a divorce i felt sorry for louis hardin later recalled but he had two timed me so i gave him a divorce just to teach him a lessonand i sued him too later years in the 1930s sometimes billing herself as mrs louis armstrong hardin led an all girl orchestra then a mixed gender big band which broadcast nationally over the nbc radio network the same decade she recorded a series of sides for decca records as a swing genre early 1950s hardin worked mostly as a soloist singing and playing piano in the late 1940s she decided to leave the music and become a tailor so she took a course in tailoring her graduation project was to make a tuxedo for louis it was displayed prominently at a new york cocktail party she threw to announce her new field of endeavor they looked at louis tux and all the other things i had made and they were very impressed she recalled but then someone asked me to play the piano that s when i knew that i would never be able to leave the music business louis wore hardin s tuxedo and she continued to tailor but only as a sideline and then only for friends her shirts which friends received regularly on birthdays proudly bore a label with her mother s name decie and beneath that hand made by lil armstrong hardin eventually returned to chicago and the house on east 41st street she also made a trip but mostly she worked around chicago often with fellow chicagoans collaborators included red saunders joe williams oscar brown jr and little brother montgomery in the 1950s hardin recorded a biographical narrative for riverside s bill grauer which was issued in lp form she would again appear on that label in 1961 participating in its chicago the living legends project as accompanist for alberta hunter and leader of her own hastily assembled big band at that time her favorite living pianists were thelonious monk and billy taylor which helps to explain why when riverside producer chris albertson approached her about these recordings her immediate reaction was who s going to listen to that old stuff the riverside recordings led to her inclusion in a star studded 1961 nbc network special chicago and all that jazz and a follow up album released through the verve records imprint in 1962 hardin began writing her autobiography in collaboration with albertson but she had second thoughts when she realized that such a might discomfit louis armstrong so the project was shelved with only five chapters written death when armstrong died in 1971 hardin was deeply shaken by the loss she traveled to new york for the funeral and rode in the family car i think louis would have found a way getting back at me if i had n t put hardin in that car his widow lucille told albertson returning to chicago hardin felt that work on her autobiography could now continue but the following month performing at a televised memorial concert for louis lil hardin armstrong collapsed at the piano she died an hour later aged 73 imageskyline cahircastle06 jpg subdivisiontype country cahir is a town in county

pygmaeus from australia and feather tailed possum distoechurus pennatus from new guinea this family of the diprotodontia order which can be found in the east coast and inland of australia and in some islands of new guinea is characterized by their very small size which has side effects because their mass to surface area ratio is so small heat escapes quicker from their bodies than it would in larger animals the larger the mass to surface area ratio the harder it is to get rid of heat therefore when temperature drops or food is scarce they have trouble maintaining their body temperature and they enter a state known as torpidity not to be confused with hibernation which is not known in marsupials which can last between one day and two weeks in this state drops to almost that of its

mantle below the crust because they do not all move in the same direction plates often directly collide or move laterally along each other a tectonic environment that environments most occur on faults near plate margins by definition intraplate earthquakes do not occur near plate boundaries but along faults in the normally stable interior of plates these earthquakes often occur at the location of ancient failed rifts because such old structures may present a weakness in the crust where it can easily slip to accommodate regional tectonic strain compared to earthquakes near plate boundaries intraplate earthquakes are not well understood and the hazards associated with them may be difficult to quantify historic examples historic examples of intraplate earthquakes include those in mineral virginia in 2011 estimated magnitude 5 8 new madrid in 1811 and 1812 estimated magnitude as high as 8 1 the boston cape ann earthquake of 1755 estimated magnitude 6 0 to 6 3 earthquakes felt in new york city in 1737 and 1884 both quakes estimated at about 5 5 magnitude and the charleston earthquake in south carolina in 1886 estimated magnitude 6 5 to 7 3 the charleston quake was particularly surprising had almost no history of even minor earthquakes in 2001 a large intraplate earthquake devastated the region of gujarat india the earthquake occurred far from any plate boundaries which meant the region above the epicenter was unprepared for earthquakes in particular the kutch district suffered tremendous damage where the death toll was over 12 000 causes many cities live with the seismic risk of a rare large intraplate earthquake the cause of these earthquakes is often uncertain in many cases the causative fault is deeply buried and sometimes can not even be found under these circumstances it is difficult to calculate the exact seismic hazard for a given city especially if there was only one earthquake in historical times some progress is being made in understanding the fault mechanics driving these earthquakes prediction scientists continue to search for the causes of these earthquakes and especially for some indication of how often they recur the best success has come with detailed micro seismic monitoring involving dense arrays of seismometers causative fault can be located with great accuracy and in most cases these line up in patterns consistent with faulting cryoseisms can sometimes be mistaken for intraplate earthquakes louisburg is the name of some places in the united states of america and canada louisbourg nova scotia canada often spelled

bathroom is a room for personal hygiene generally containing a bathtub or a shower and possibly also a bidet in north america and some other regions it characteristically contains a toilet and a sink hence in north american english the word bathroom is commonly used to mean any room containing a toilet even a public toilet although in the united states this is more commonly called a restroom in other countries including the uk australia france and japan homes may have a separate toilet in iran almost all homes have two distinct rooms for bathroom and toilet room history the first records for the use of baths date back as far as 3000 b c at this time water had a strong religious value being seen as a purifying element for both body and soul and so it was not uncommon for people to be required to cleanse themselves before entering a sacred area baths are recorded as part of a village or town life throughout this period america and cold baths in asia communal baths were erected in a distinctly separate area to the living quarters of the village with a view to preventing evil spirits from entering the domestic quarters of a commune according to teresi et al 2002 the third millennium b c was the age of cleanliness toilets and sewers were invented in several parts of the world and mohenjo daro circa 2800 b c had some of the most advanced with lavatories built into the outer walls of houses these were western style toilets made from bricks with wooden seats on top they had vertical chutes through which waste fell into street drains or cesspits sir mortimer wheeler the director general of archaeology in india from 1944 to 1948 wrote the high quality of the sanitary arrangements could well be envied in many parts of the world today nearly all of the hundreds of houses excavated had their own bathing rooms generally located on the ground floor the bath was made of brick sometimes drained away through a hole in the floor down chutes or pottery pipes in the walls into the municipal drainage system even the fastidious egyptians rarely had special bathrooms not all ancient baths were in the style of the large pools that often come to mind when one imagines the roman baths the earliest surviving bathtub dates back to 1700 b c and hails from the palace of knossos in crete what is remarkable about this tub is not only the similarity with the baths of today but also the way in which the plumbing works surrounding it differ so little from modern models a more advanced prehistoric 15th century bc and before system of baths and plumbing is to be found in the excavated town of akrotiri on the aegean island of thera there alabaster tubs and other bath fittings were found along with a sophisticated twin plumbing system to transport hot and cold water separately this was probably because of easy access to geothermic hot springs on this volcanic island both the an important part of their lifestyles writers such as homer had their heroes bathe in warm water so as to regain their strength it is perhaps notable that the mother of achilles bathed him in order to gain his invincibility palaces have been uncovered throughout greece with areas that are dedicated to bathing spaces with ceramic bathtubs as well as sophisticated drainage systems homer uses the word loetr baths later loutr from the verb loein to bathe the same root finds an even earlier attestation on linear b tablets in the name of the river lousios bathing river in arcadia public baths are mentioned by the comedian aristophanes as balanea sing balaneon latinized as balneum a balneary the roman attitudes towards bathing are well documented they built large purpose built thermal baths marking not only an important social development rejuvenation here was a place where people could meet to discuss the matters of the day and enjoy entertainment during this period there was a distinction between private and public baths with many wealthy families having their own thermal baths in their houses despite this they still made use of the public baths showing the value that they had as a public institution the strength of the roman empire was telling in this respect imports from throughout the world allowed the roman citizens to enjoy ointments incense combs and mirrors although some sources suggest that bathing declined following the collapse of the roman empire this is not completely accurate it was actually the middle ages that saw the beginning of soap production proof that bathing was definitely not uncommon it was only after the renaissance that bathing declined water was feared as a carrier of disease and thus sweat baths and heavy perfumes were preferred in fact throughout the 16th 17th and 18th centuries the use of public baths declined thus laying the foundations for the bathroom as it was to become in the 20th century however in japan shared bathing in sento and onsen spas still exists the latter being very popular variations powder room a powder room also called 1 2 bath or guest bath usually refers to a room with a toilet and a sink and commonly used by guests shower room a shower room or shower room is a room that contains a shower cubicle or shower stall but no bathtub in the united states this would be called a 3 4 bathroom ensuite an ensuite bathroom or ensuite shower room also en suite ensuite and other variations is a bathroom or shower room attached to and only accessible from a bedroom family bathroom a family bathroom in british estate agent terminology is a full bathroom in a house jack and jill bathroom a jack and jill bathroom is a bathroom with a wetroom is a waterproof room usually equipped with a shower it is designed to eliminate moisture damage that is caused to a home and is also compatible with the heating systems beneath the floor regional differences australia and new zealand in australia new zealand and other british commonwealth countries it is common for a bathroom to not contain a lavatory but with a separate toilet next door a very small room with only a toilet and perhaps a tiny hand washbasin terminology in the united states in the united states bathrooms are generally categorized as master bathroom containing a shower and a tub that is adjoining to a master bedroom a full bathroom or full bath containing four plumbing fixtures bathtub shower toilet and sink half 1 2 bath or powder room containing just a toilet and sink and 3 4 bath containing toilet sink and shower although the terms vary from market sink and shower are considered a full bath this lack of a single universal definition commonly results in discrepancies between advertised and actual number of baths in real estate listings an additional complication is that there are currently two ways of notating the number of bathrooms in a dwelling one method is to count a half bathroom as 5 and then add this to the number of full bathrooms e g 2 5 baths would mean 2 full baths and 1 half bath the other newer method is to put the number of full bathrooms to the left side of the decimal point and to put the number of half bathrooms to the right of the decimal point e g 2 1 would mean 2 full baths and 1 half bath 3 2 would mean 3 full baths and 2 half baths design considerations the design of a bathroom must account for the use of both hot and cold water in significant quantities for cleaning the human body the water is also used for moving tank water may be splashed on the walls and floor and hot humid air may cause condensation on cold surfaces from a decorating point of view the bathroom presents a challenge ceiling wall and floor materials and coverings should be impervious to water and readily and easily cleaned the use of ceramic or glass as well as smooth plastic materials is common in bathrooms for their ease of cleaning such surfaces are often cold to the touch however and so water resistant bath mats or even bathroom carpets may be used on the floor to make the room more comfortable alternatively the floor may be heated possibly by strategically placing heater conduits close to the surface electrical appliances such as lights heaters and heated towel rails generally need to be installed as fixtures with permanent connections rather than plugs and sockets this minimizes the risk of electric shock ground fault circuit interruptor electrical sockets can reduce the risk of electric shock and are required for bathroom socket installation by electrical in some countries such as the united kingdom only special sockets suitable for electric shavers are permitted in bathrooms and are labelled as such uk building regulations also define what type of electrical light fittings i e how water splash proof may be installed in the areas zones around and above baths sinks and showers bathroom lighting should be uniform bright and must minimize glare for all the activities like shaving showering grooming etc one must ensure equitable lighting across the entire bathroom space the mirror area should definitely have at least two sources of light at least 1 feet apart to eliminate any shadows on the face skin tones and hair color are highlighted with

council of states from 1905 member of the grand council of the canton of thurgau for four years he presided over the fdp in the swiss federal assembly on the 12th of february 1920 he was elected to the federal council and was in charge of the justice and police department from which he resigned on april 30 1934 twice in 1926 and 1931 he was elected president of the federal council making him the highest ranking representative of the swiss confederation biography family background education heinrich hberlin was born 1868 in weinfelden as the son of friedrich heinrich hberlin 1834 1897 the hberlin family was influential on many levels in swiss politics over the years and for this reason was occasionally referred to as the dynastengeschlecht der hberlinge family dynasty was president of the council of states professional life upon graduation from kantonsschule frauenfeld in 1887 he began law studies at the university of zrich and continued his studies at the university of leipzig and at the humboldt university in berlin while in leipzig which was the german stronghold for jurisprudence he formed a friendship with prinz ferdinand von hohenzollern sigmaringen who was later crowned king ferdinand i of great romania though their ways parted they met again years later when king ferdinand i was on an official state visit in switzerland hberlin received his lawyers license in 1891 and completed a short internship in lausanne at the lawyers office of federal councillor louis ruchonnet in 1892 he opened his own law firm in weinfelden which two years later he moved to the canton capital of frauenfeld he quickly gained a reputation for being an outstanding lawyer and became the most sought after in this area of switzerland from 1899 to 1920 he presided over the district court frauenfeld hberlin got actively judges and lawyers at that time and in 1904 he was elected into the swiss federal council of which he was president in 1918 1919 in addition to his political activities at the national level hberlin was also active in local politics in the canton of thurgau in 1905 he was elected to the grand council of the canton of thurgau where he served for 15 years twice he was appointed president of the grand council 1909 10 and 1915 16 following the resignation of federal councillor calonder hberlin was elected in the first ballot with 124 out of 159 votes as successor on february 12 1920 while in office he was in charge of the justice and police department during his time in the federal council he was president of the swiss confederation in 1926 and 1931 hberlin was to a large extent instrumental in the unification of criminal law characteristic of his tenure were particularly two rejected laws by the people for the expansion of state security laws which became known as lex hberlin i to protect the civil and democratic state against extremist influences and in the wake of the rise of nazism in germany he was strongly condemning fascist and nazi totalitarianism based on his democratic liberal attitude and was warning of the danger of hitlers martial aspirations as early as 1932 moreover he was highly regarded for his expertise in his chosen field the sharpness and preciseness of his dialectic skills wit and humour he was known for having a strong sense of justice whether royalty upper class or common people he treated them all equally with the collapse of the austro hungarian empire kaiser karl i and his wife zita von bourbon parma went into exile in switzerland kaiser karl i gave his word of honor to the swiss authorities to give notification in case of any intentions of travelling abroad however he broke it twice and went to hungary in a futile attempt to restore the monarchy and to regain power over his lost empire after that based on hberlins initiative the whole family and their violation of swiss asylum law and were asked to leave nevertheless when one of the children of empress zita came down with appendectomy and needed to undergo surgery in zrich hberlin granted them visa extensions for the time being retirement even after his retirement he was still much sought after in important matters he became a board member of one of the biggest swiss insurance companies winterthur and also first president of pro helvetia and was friends and acquaintance with such diverse personalities as the famous german writer hermann hesse and walter mittelholzer who was not only a pioneer of swiss aviation but also one of the first aviation entrepreneurs others included the nobel prize winner for literature romain rolland the swiss painters cuno amiet who is considered a pioneer of modern art in switzerland and carl liner among others hberlin died 1947 in frauenfeld anecdotes hberlins most famous and interesting client at the time when he practiced law in weinfelden was certainly the airship inventor count ferdinand von zeppelin 1838 1917 in hberlins 1934 in which he writes that count zeppelin was among other things his client in manners such as border disputes with the eminent psychiatrist ludwig binswanger 1881 1966 who was running an exclusive psychiatric clinic nearby the sanatorium bellevue when hberlin and the count were discussing business matters in the lounge of the counts family estate schloss girsberg it was not rare that they heard the propeller noise of count zeppelins airship passing by in moments like these count zeppelins attention was drawn away from matters at hand and hberlin suggested excellency shall we take a break until the airship has passed upon which count zeppelin stood up went to the window with a smile saying yes you are right sir in the rare moments of leisurely life hberlin found a lot of comfort in mountaineering and one day he took his wife to the beautiful alpine village of zermatt and when he was introducing her to the different peaks surrounding it an american tourist standing nearby overheard his explanations and assumed hberlin and asked politely if it was possible to have him the president of the federal council of switzerland as a mountain guide in his usual manner of being low key the president politely explained to the american that he was on a holiday with his wife to show her the natural wonders of the swiss alps and thus wasnt the mountain guide the gentlemen had mistaken him to be during wwi hberlin was a regiment commander and was stationed with his troops in the swiss alps in those days it was strongly prohibited for the soldier in charge of guarding horse carriages to ride on top of the carriage instead the soldier had the duty to run behind the carriage in case anything of the load fell off during the transportation needless to say the soldier on duty was not too thrilled with this task especially when the carriage was empty after delivering the goods and still he was not allowed to ride on it so one day a guard of hberlins regiment sat next up to the coachman on their goods at the designated area they were going on a mountainous road which had many turns when all of a sudden hberlin appeared out of nowhere and harshly questioned the guard why he was sitting on the coach instead of running alongside it the flabbergasted soldier answered in all honesty because colonel sir i have noticed you too late upon hearing this hberlin started to laugh heartily and let the soldier off the hook due to the guards

by nation religious art or sacred art is artistic imagery using religious inspiration and motifs and is often intended to uplift the mind to the spiritual sacred art involves the ritual and cultic practices and practical and operative aspects of the path of the spiritual realization within the artist s religious tradition christian art christian sacred art is produced in an attempt to illustrate supplement and portray in tangible form the principles of christianity though other definitions are possible most christian groups use or have used art to some extent although some have had strong objections to some forms of religious image and there have been major periods of iconoclasm within christianity most christian art is allusive or built around themes familiar to the intended observer one of the most common christian themes is that of the virgin mary holding the infant jesus another is that of christ on the cross for the benefit of the illiterate an elaborate iconographic system developed to conclusively identify scenes for example saint agnes depicted with a a shamrock each saint holds or is associated with attributes and symbols in sacred art history early christian art survives from dates near the origins of christianity the oldest surviving christian paintings are from the site at megiddo dated to around the year 70 and the oldest christian sculptures are from sarcophagi dating to the beginning of the 2nd century until the adoption of christianity by constantine christian art derived its style and much of its iconography from popular roman art but from this point grand christian buildings built under imperial patronage brought a need for christian versions of roman elite and official art of which mosaics in churches in rome are the most prominent surviving examples during the development of christian art in the byzantine empire see byzantine art a more abstract aesthetic replaced the naturalism previously established in hellenistic art this new style was hieratic meaning its primary purpose was to convey religious meaning rather than accurately render objects and people realistic perspective proportions light and color were ignored and standardized conventions to portray individuals and events the controversy over the use of graven images the interpretation of the second commandment and the crisis of byzantine iconoclasm led to a standardization of religious imagery within the eastern orthodoxy the renaissance saw an increase in monumental secular works but until the protestant reformation christian art continued to be produced in great quantities both for churches and clergy and for the laity during this time michelangelo buonarroti painted the sistine chapel and carved the famous piet gianlorenzo bernini created the massive columns in st peter s basilica and leonardo da vinci painted the last supper the reformation had a huge effect on christian art rapidly bringing the production of public christian art to a virtual halt in protestant countries and causing the destruction of most of the art that already existed as a secular non sectarian universal notion of art arose in 19th century western europe secular artists occasionally treated christian themes bouguereau included in the historical canon such as rouault or stanley spencer however many modern artists such as eric gill marc chagall henri matisse jacob epstein elizabeth frink and graham sutherland have produced well known works of art for churches since the advent of printing the sale of reproductions of pious works has been a major element of popular christian culture in the nineteenth century this included genre painters such as mihly munkcsy the invention of color lithography led to broad circulation of holy cards in the modern era companies specializing in modern commercial christian artists such as thomas blackshear and thomas kinkade although widely regarded in the fine art world as kitsch have been very successful the last part of the 20th and the first part of the 21st century have seen a focused effort by artists who claim faith in christ to re establish art with themes that revolve around faith christ god the church the bible and other classic christian themes as worthy of respect by the secular art world both in sacred and secular arts other notable artists include larry d alexander gary p bergel carlos cazares bruce herman deborah sokolove and john august swanson see also madonna and child icon images of jesus buddhist art buddhist art originated on the indian subcontinent following the historical life of siddhartha gautama 6th to 5th century bc and thereafter evolved by contact with other cultures as it spread throughout asia and the world buddhist art followed believers as the dharma spread adapted and evolved in each new host country it developed to the north through central asia and into eastern asia to form the northern branch of buddhist art and to the east as far as southeast asia to form the southern branch of buddhist art in india buddhist art flourished and even influenced the development of hindu art until buddhism nearly disappeared in india around the 10th century due in part to the vigorous expansion of islam alongside hinduism tibetan buddhist art most tibetan buddhist tantra tibetan art includes thangkas and mandalas often including depictions of buddhas and bodhisattvas creation of buddhist art is usually done as a meditation as well as creating an object as aid to meditation an example of this is the creation of a sand mandala by monks before and after the construction prayers are recited and the form of the mandala represents the pure surroundings palace of a buddha on which is meditated to train the mind the work is rarely if ever signed by the artist other tibetan buddhist art includes metal ritual objects such as the vajra and the phurba indian buddhist art two places suggest more vividly than any others the vitality of buddhist cave painting from about the 5th century ad one is ajanta a site in india long forgotten until discovered in 1817 the other is dunhuang one of the great oasis staging posts on the silk road the paintings range from calm devotional images of the buddha to lively and crowded scenes often indian sculpture than in painting major art included mosques and a madonna art of mary and possibly her child islamic art a prohibition against depicting representational images in religious art as well as the naturally decorative nature of arabic script led to the use of calligraphic decorations which usually involved repeating geometrical patterns that expressed ideals of order and nature it was used on religious architecture carpets and handwritten documents islamic art has reflected this balanced harmonious world view it focuses on spiritual essence rather than physical form while there has been an aversion to potential idol worship through islamic history this is a distinctly modern sunni view persian miniatures along with medieval depictions of muhammad and angels in islam stand as prominent examples contrary to the modern sunni tradition also shi a muslims are much less averse to the depiction of figures including the prophets as long as the depiction is respectful figure representation in islamic sacred art the islamic resistance to the representation of living beings forms is unique to god and it is for this reason that the role of images and image makers has been controversial he strongest statements on the subject of figural depiction are made in the hadith traditions of the prophet where painters are challenged to breathe life into their creations and threatened with punishment on the day of judgment the qur an is less specific but condemns idolatry and uses the arabic term musawwir maker of forms or artist as an epithet for god partially as a result of this religious sentiment figures in painting were often stylized and in some cases the destruction of figurative artworks occurred iconoclasm was previously known in the byzantine period and aniconicism was a feature of the judaic world thus placing the islamic objection to figurative representations within a larger context as ornament however figures were largely devoid of any larger significance and perhaps therefore posed less challenge as with other forms of islamic ornamentation artists freely adapted and stylized basic human and animal forms giving rise calligraphy is the most highly regarded and most fundamental element of islamic art it is significant that the qur an the book of god s revelations to the prophet muhammad was transmitted in arabic and that inherent within the arabic script is the potential for developing a variety of ornamental forms the employment of calligraphy as ornament had a definite aesthetic appeal but often also included an underlying talismanic component while most works of art had legible inscriptions not all muslims would have been able to read them one should always keep in mind however that calligraphy is principally a means to transmit a text albeit in a decorative form from its simple and primitive early examples of the 5th and 6th century a d the arabic alphabet developed rapidly after the rise of islam in the 7th century into a beautiful form of art the main two families of calligraphic styles were the dry styles called generally the kufic and the soft cursive styles which include naskhi thuluth nastaliq and many others the three nonfigural types of decoration in islamic art which also include calligraphy and vegetal patterns whether isolated or used in combination with nonfigural ornamentation or figural representation geometric patterns are popularly associated with islamic art largely due to their aniconic quality these abstract designs not only adorn the surfaces of monumental islamic architecture but also function as the major decorative element on a vast array of objects of all types the tamaraw or mindoro dwarf buffalo with the scientific name bubalus mindorensis is a small hoofed mammal belonging to the family bovidae it is endemic to the island of mindoro in the philippines and is the only endemic philippine bovine it is believed however to have once also thrived on the larger island of luzon the tamaraw was originally found all over mindoro from sea level up to the mountains 2000 meters above sea level but because of human habitation hunting and logging it is now restricted to only a few remote grassy plains and is now an endangered species contrary to common belief and past classification the tamaraw is not a subspecies of the local carabao which is only slightly larger or the common water buffalo in contrast to the carabao it has a number of distinguishing characteristics it is slightly hairier has light markings on its face is not gregarious and has shorter horns that are in the country anatomy and morphology bubalus mindorensis has the appearance of a typical member of its family it has a compact heavyset bovine body four legs that end in cloven hooves and a small horned head at the end of a short neck it is smaller and stockier compared to the asiatic water buffalo bubalus bubalis there is little sexual dimorphism in the species although males are reported to have thicker necks the tamaraw has an average shoulder height of 100 105cm in the length of the body is 2 2m ft while the tail adds a further 60cm in reported weights have ranged from 180to300kg lb adults have a dark brown to grayish color and more hair than bubalus bubalis the limbs are short and stocky white markings are seen in the hooves and the inner lower forelegs these markings are similar to that of the anoa bubalus depressicornis the face is the same color of the species also has a pair of gray white strips that begins from the inner corner of the eye to the horns the nose and lips have black skin the ears are 13 5 centimeters long from notch to tip with white markings on the insides both sexes grows short black horns in a v shaped manner compared to c shaped horns of bubalus bubalis the horns have flat surfaces and are triangular at their base due to the regular rubbing the tamaraw s horns have a worn outer surface but with rough inner sides the horns are reported to be 35 5 to 51 0 centimeters long however as anti malarial medicine was developed more people settled on the island the increase in human activity has drastically reduced tamaraw population by 1966 the tamaraw s range was reduced to three areas mount iglit mount calavite and areas near the sablayan penal settlement by 2000 their range was further reduced to only two areas the mounts iglit baco national park and aruyan initial estimates of the at around 10 000 individuals in the early 1900s less than fifty years later in 1949 the population had dwindled to around a thousand individuals by 1953 fewer than 250 animals were estimated to be alive these population estimates continually grew smaller until the iucn publication of their 1969 red data book where the tamaraw population was noted to be an alarmingly low 100 heads this head count rose to 120 animals in 1975 current estimates place the wild tamaraw population from thirty to two hundred individuals ecology and life history as a rare endemic mammal on a relatively secluded island the ecology of the tamaraw is largely unknown individuals of the species are reclusive and shy away from humans in addition the small sizes of the species subpopulations already spread thin throughout their fragmented range on 1986 about 51 individuals are found in a 20 square kilometer area make contact with any more than a solitary individual a rarity habitat bubalus mindorensis in thick brush near open canopied glades where it may graze and feed on grasses since human habitation and subsequent forest fragmentation of their home island of mindoro the habitat preferences of the tamaraw have somewhat expanded to lower altitude grassy plains within their mountainous environment tamaraws will usually be found not far from sources of water trophic ecology the tamaraw is a grazer that feeds on grasses and young bamboo shoots although it is known to prefer cogon and talahib saccharum spontaneum they are naturally diurnal feeding during the daytime hours however daytime human activities have recently forced select b mindorensis individuals to be nocturnal to avoid human contact life history the tamaraw is known to live for about 20 years with an estimated lifespan of about 25 the adult female tamaraw gives birth to one offspring after a gestation period of about 300 days there is an interbirth interval of two years although one female has been sighted with its mother before becoming independent behavioral ecology unlike the closely related water buffalo b mindorensis is a solitary creature adults of the species do not occur in herds or smaller packs and are often encountered alone only juveniles exhibit the typical bovine herding behavior and clan hierarchy often seen in water buffalo males and females are known to associate all year round but this interaction lasts only a few hours it has been suggested that this solitary behavior is an adaptation to its forest environment adult males are often solitary and apparently aggressive while adult females can be alone accompanied by a bull or three young of different ages similar to other bovines the tamaraw wallows in mud pits it has been suggested that this behavior is employed by the animals in order to avoid biting insects another distinct behavior in b mindorensis is their fierceness there are reports concerning their fierceness when cornered although most are unsubstantiated threat posture used by the bovine involves vertical position this is accompanied with a lateral shaking of the head evolutionary history the presence of b mindorensis on the island of mindoro coupled with the discovery of fossil bubalids in other islands around the archipelago indicates that the family was once widespread throughout the philippines recent genetic analysis studies of the family members further strengthen this view etymology and taxonomic history the tamaraw was originally described as anoa mindorensis by the french zoologist pierre marie heude in 1888 in 1958 it was described as anoa bubalis mindorensis a subspecies of the then water buffalo species anoa bubalis a little over a decade after the tamaraw was elevated to species status as anoa mindorensis in 1969 the name tamaraw has other variants like tamarau tamarou and tamarao it has been suggested that the term which is a probable alternative name for the banteng bos javanicus conservation being an entirely endemic and rare land mammal bubalus mindorensis stands as an extremely vulnerable species currently it is classified as a critically endangered species and has been so since 2000 by the iucn on its iucn red list of endangered species awareness of the conservation status of bubalus mindorensis began way back in 1965 when it was classified as status inadequately known by the iucn enough data was gathered on the tamaraw population by 1986 and the iucn conservation monitoring center declared the species endangered throughout succeeding surveys conducted in 1988 1990 1994 and 1996 the species remained listed on the red list as endangered the relisting of the species in 1996 fulfilled the iucn criteria b1 2c and d1 criterion b1 indicated that the species range was less less than five independent locations a noticed continuing decline in the population fulfilled sub criterion 2c given the condition of the population s sole habitat criterion d1 essentially required that a population be composed of less than 250 mature individuals individual counts of the b mindorensis population at the time figured significantly lower than this in 2000 the tamaraw was relisted on the red list under the more severe c1 criteria this was due to estimates that the population would decline by 20 in five years or within the timespan of two generations many factors have contributed to the decline of the tamaraw population over the course of the century the increase of the human population on mindoro has exposed the island s sole tamaraw population to severe anthropogenic pressures in the 1930s the introduction of non native cattle on the island caused a severe rinderpest epidemic among the tamaraw population then numbering in the thousands hunting of tamaraws for food and sustenance has also most major factor threatening survival of b mindorensis is habitat loss due to infrastructure development logging and agriculture these factors reduced the population of thousands during the early 1900s to less than 300 individuals in 2007 due to the decline of the b mindorensis population various philippine laws and organizations have been created towards the conservation of the species in 1936 commonwealth act no 73 was enacted by the then philippine commonwealth the act specifically prohibited killing hunting and even merely wounding tamaraws with an exception noted for self defense if one were to be attacked by an agitated individual or for scientific purposes the penalties were harsh enough to include a hefty fine and imprisonment in 1979 an executive order was signed creating a committee specifically geared towards the conservation of the tamaraw the tamaraw was referred to as a source of national pride in the said e o the tamaraw conservation project was also established in 1979 the organization has successfully bred a tamaraw nicknamed kali act 9147 or the wildlife resources conservation and protection act was enacted to protect the tamaraw and other endemic species from hunting and sale during the 1970s a gene pool was established to preserve the tamaraw s numbers however the project was not successful as only one offspring named kali was produced as of 2011 kali is the only surviving animal in the gene pooling project the project was also not improved as the protected areas and wildlife bureau shown that the tamaraws were already breeding in the wild cloning was not implemented for conservation as the department of environment and natural resource argued that such measures would diminish the genetic diversity of the species a small subpopulation of tamaraw has been found within the confines of the mt iglit game refuge and bird sanctuary on the same island of mindoro as of may 2007 bubalus mindorensis is on appendix i of the convention on international trade in endangered species where it has been since the species was with the listing cites recognizes the species as critically endangered and threatened with extinction thus international commercial trade in the species or any derivatives of which such as the meat horns or flesh is considered illegal while commercial trade in the species is prohibited exchange for non commercial reasons such as scientific research is allowed importance to humans economical and commercial value while not as heavily exploited as other large endangered mammals the tamaraw population on mindoro was subject to some harvesting pressure from subsistence hunters before conservation efforts were spurred towards the latter half of the 20th century the iucn has described this as still ongoing in their 2006 red list report in philippine culture though the national animal of the philippines is the carabao in the 1970s toyota motors through the defunct local company delta motors built the tamaraw auv asian utility vehicle because of its ruggedness and simplicity of design some examples still survive to this day copied by multinational companies ford manufacturers to this day because it is an asian utility vehicle it shares its design with the kijang the indonesian version automobile maker toyota once held a franchise in the philippine basketball association naming its team the toyota tamaraws see below during the wake of the asian utility popularity in the 1990s toyota motors philippines released an asian utility vehicle called tamaraw fx in the philippines an evolution of the tamaraw auv it was widely patronized by taxi operators and was immediately turned into a staple mode of transportation much like a cross of the taxi and the jeepney the fx eventually evolved into the revo the tamaraw is also the mascot of the varsity teams of the far eastern university feu tamaraws in the university athletic association of the philippines and of the toyota tamaraws of the philippine basketball

electronics it launched its first home computer the abc 80 in 1978 the succeeding abc 800 series was introduced in 1981 with new releases in 1983 being produced until the abc line was terminated in 1986 history the company was established in 1923 by axel harald holstensson 1889 1979 he was the son of an ore loader and had no training other than a few years of elementary school he worked as an electrician and eventually as a travel fitter and foreman at asea years from 1907 to 1918 in his spare time he studied electrical engineering in 1918 he moved to motala and started an electronics store and installation company motala electric agency the post war depression however led almost to bankruptcy situation was critical and the resort and it was shown to be possible to sell a number of devices at a profit so axel holstensson registered the luxor radio factory company in 1923 the name luxor was apposite and then very topical as the tomb of tutankhamen had just been discovered near the city of luxor in egypt the final years finnish company nokia became a principal owner in the company in 1984 computer production was discontinued in 1986 followed by television production in motala in 1992 when the production moved to finland instead it produced receivers for cable and satellite television but nokia wanted to streamline its business to mobile telephony and therefore sold the satellite receiver business in 1998 to american company space craft inc the company continued to manufacture satellite receivers in motala until 2002 when it was transferred to low cost countries in 1997 nokia sold its car speaker and audio amplifier business to harman international industries a collaboration with the then electrolux owned autoliv ab led to the company first became a partner for luxor electronics is still manufacturing various types of electronic products for the automotive industry remains luxor is currently owned by a turkish company vestel and used for television sold

comprises some 80 accepted taxa including several natural hybrids the genus is native to southeast asia the indian subcontinent southern china new guinea and the solomon and bismarck islands the species and their hybrids are extensively cultivated and are known as either paphiopedilums or by the abbreviation paphs in horticulture the type species of this genus is paphiopedilum insigne description paphiopedilum species naturally occur among humus layers as terrestrials on the forest floor while a few are true epiphytes and some are lithophytes these sympodial orchids lack pseudobulbs instead they grow robust shoots each with several leaves some are hemicryptophytes the leaves can be short and rounded or long and narrow and typically have a mottled pattern when older shoots die newer ones take is fully grown producing a raceme between the fleshy succulent leaves the roots are thick and fleshy potted plants form a tight lump of roots that when untangled can be up to 1 m long members of this genus are considered highly collectible by orchid fanciers due to the curious and unusual form of their flowers along with cypripedium mexipedium phragmipedium and selenipedium the genus is a member of the subfamily cypripedioideae commonly referred to as the lady s slippers or slipper orchids due to the unusual shape of the pouch like labellum of the flower the pouch traps insects seeking nectar and to leave again they have to climb up past the staminode behind which they collect or deposit pollinia the orchid despite several attempts to clone by tissue culture has never been successfully cloned for unknown reasons this means every plant is unique in horticulture the paphiopedilums are among the most widely cultivated being discovered every now and then for example the golden slipper orchid p armeniacum discovered in 1979 and described in 1982 amazed growers of orchids by the extraordinary beauty of its golden flowers in addition growers have bred thousands of interspecific hybrids and registered them with the royal horticultural society in london over the years these orchids are relatively easy to grow indoors as long as conditions that mimic their natural habitats are created most species thrive in moderate to high humidity 50 70 moderate temperatures ranging from 13 to 35 degrees celsius and low light of 12 000 to 20 000 lux modern hybrids are typically easier to grow in artificial conditions than their parent species taxonomy and systematics the genus name paphiopedilum was established by ernst hugo heinrich pfitzer in 1886 it is derived from paphos a city in cyprus a place sacred to aphrodite it was said she landed at the site when rose from the sea as her birth and no paphiopedilum occurs on cyprus amp ndash at least not as the genus is understood today but it was long mixed up with its holarctic relative cypripedium which indeed grows in the mediterranean region paphiopedilum was finally decided to be a valid taxon in 1959 but its use has become restricted to eastern asian species in our time subdivisions the genus paphiopedilum has been divided into several subgenera and then further into sections and subsections subgenus parvisepalum subgenus brachypetalum subgenus polyantha section mastigopetalum section polyantha section mystropetalum section stictopetalum section paphiopedilum section

nyra is also a character in kathryn lasky s guardians of ga hoole series the ashvamedha sanskrit avamedh horse sacrifice was one of the most important royal rituals of vedic religion described in detail in the yajurveda ts 7 1 5 vsm 22 amp ndash 25 and the pertaining commentary in the shatapatha brahmana bm 13 1 amp ndash 5 the rigveda does have descriptions of horse sacrifice notably in hymns rv 1 162 163 which are themselves known as but does not allude to the full ritual according to the yajurveda as per brahma vaivarta purana 185 180 on the next morning the priests raise the queen from the place where she has spent the night with the horse with the dadhikra verse rv 4 39 6 yv vsm 23 32 a verse used as a purifier after obscene language the three queens with a hundred golden silver and copper needles indicate the lines on the horse s body along which it will be dissected the horse is dissected and its flesh roasted and personified concepts with utterances of svaha all hail the ashvastuti or eulogy of the horse follows rv 1 162 yv vsm 24 24 amp ndash 45 concluding with may this steed bring us all sustaining riches wealth in good kine good horses manly offspring freedom from sin may aditi vouchsafe us the steed with our oblations gain us lordship the priests performing the sacrifice were recompensed with a part of the booty won during the wandering of the horse according to a commentator the spoils from the east were given to the hotar while the adhvaryu a maiden a daughter of the sacrificer and the sacrificer s fourth wife the shatapatha brahmana emphasizes the royal nature of the ashvamedha verily the asvamedha means royal sway it is after royal sway that these strive who guard the horse bm 13 1 6 3 trans eggeling 1900 it repeatedly states that the asvamedha is everything bm 13 4 2 22 trans eggeling 1900 the ashvamedha soma sacrifice and incorporates other important sacrifices the ashvamedha is intended to secure prosperity for the kingdom and its subjects it is a bloody sacrifice in which the domestic animals are killed and non domestic animals are set free it ends with a further sacrifice of twenty one cows gifts are then given to the officers culminating in the gift to the priests of the four wives of the king or their attendants the human sacrifice the purushamedha followed a similar format but included a man with the animals to be sacrificed the price of the man was set at one thousand cows and a hundred horses like the horse the man chosen for sacrifice was allowed to wander for a year once he had been killed the queen lay with his corpse the ashvamedha celebrated the king as king of the whole world not as king of a part of the world that constituted his kingdom the stature of a king was not related to a particular part of the world that might the horse was considered a noble animal and was associated with the military class when the asvamedha has been performed in historical times it has been more to demonstrate vedic orthodoxy than for genuinely religious reasons the laws of manu refer to the ashvamedha v 53 the man who offers a horse sacrifice every day for a hundred years and the man who does not eat meat the two of them reap the same fruit of good deeds known historical performances pusyamitra sunga is said to have performed the ashvamedha rite after he toppled mauryan rule in 185 bc a historically documented performance of the ashvamedha is during the reign of samudragupta i died 380 the father of chandragupta ii special coins were minted to commemorate the ashvamedha and the king took on the title of maharajadhiraja after successful completion of the sacrifice there were a few later performances one by raja of kannauj jai chandra rathod in the 12th century unsuccessfully as prithviraj chauhan thwarted his known instance seems to be in 1716 ce by jai singh ii of amber of jaipur performances in hindu epics performances of the ashvamedha feature in the epics ramayana 1 10 amp ndash 15 and mahabharata in the mahabharata the sacrifice is performed by yudhishtira book 14 his brothers guarding the horse as it roamed into neighbouring kingdoms arjuna defeats all challengers the mahabharata says that the ashvamedha as performed by yudhishtira adhered to the letter of the vedic prescriptions after the horse was cut into parts draupadi had to sit beside the parts of the horse in the ramayana rama s father dasharatha performs the ashvamedha which is described in the bala kanda book 1 of the poem the ramayana provides far more detail than the mahabharata the ritual take place for three days preceded by sage rishyasringa and vasista 1 14 41 42 again it is stated that the ritual was performed in strict compliance with vedic prescriptions 1 14 10 dasaratha s chief wife kausalya circumambulates then queen kausalya desiring the results of ritual disconcertedly resided one night with that horse that flew away like a bird 1 14 34 the fat of the sacrificed horse is then burnt in ritual fire and after that the remaining parts of the body with spoons made out of plaksha tree branches 1 14 36 38 39 at the conclusion of the ritual dasharatha symbolically offers his other wives to the presiding priests who return them in exchange for expensive gifts 1 14 35 the four sides of the yagna altar is also donated to priests who had done the ritual and it is exchanged by them for gold silver cows and other gifts 1 15 43 44 in the shanti parva of the mahabharata the sacrifice is performed by king vasu uparichara by the king s decree no animals were slain during the yagna and the only offerings that were made were products of the wilderness some historians believe that the bala kanda and uttara kanda were latter interpolations to the authentic form of the ramayana due to references to greek parthians and sakas indo european comparison many indo european branches show evidence for horse sacrifice and comparative mythology suggests that they derive from a proto indo european ritual the ashvamedha is the clearest evidence preserved but vestiges from latin and celtic traditions allow the reconstruction of a few common attributes the gaulish personal name epomeduos is from ek wo medhu horse mead while ashvamedha is either from ek wo mad dho horse drunk or ek wo mey dho horse strength the reconstructed myth involves the coupling of a king with a divine mare which produced the divine twins some scholars including edgar polom regard the reconstruction of a proto indo european ritual as unjustified due to the difference between the attested traditions eiec s v horse p 278 vedanta and puranas the brhadaranyaka upanishad a mystical appendix to the shatapatha brahmana and likely the oldest of the upanishads has a creation myth where death takes the shape of a horse and includes an he became a horse ashva because it swelled ashvat and was fit for sacrifice medhya and this is why the horse sacrifice is called ashva medha therefore the sacrificers offered up the purified horse belonging to prajapati as dedicated to all the deities verily the shining sun ye tapati is the asvamedha and his body is the year agni is the sacrificial fire arka and these worlds are his bodies these two are the sacrificial fire and the asvamedha sacrifice and they are again one deity viz death brup 1 2 7 trans mller the upanishads describe ascetic austerities as an inner ashvamedha as opposed to the outer royal ritual performed in the physical world in keeping with the general tendency of vedanta to move away from priestly ritual towards spiritual introspection verse 6 of the avadhuta upanishad has through extreme devotion that is the greatest sacrifice and the greatest meditation according to the brahma vaivarta purana 185 180 the ashvamedha is one of five rites forbidden in the kali yuga in hindu revivalism in the arya samaj reform movement of dayananda sarasvati the ashvamedha is considered an allegory or a ritual to get connected to the inner sun prana dayananda in his introduction to the commentary on the vedas rejected the classical commentaries of the vedas by sayana mahidhara and uvata as medieval corruptions opposed to the real meaning of the vedas p 443 in order to arrive at an entirely symbolic interpretation of the ritual an empire is like a horse and the subjects like other inferior animals p 448 thus vsm 23 22 literally he beats on the vulva gabha the penis pasas oozes repeatedly ni galgaliti in the receptacle is interpreted but in terms of the king and his subjects the subjects are called gabha to be seized kingly power called pasa to be penetrated p 454 this interpretation is apparently based on a verse from shatapatha brahmana following dayananda arya samaj disputes the very existence of the pre vedantic ritual thus swami satya prakash saraswati claims that the word in the sense of the horse sacrifice does not occur in the samhitas in the terms of cosmic analogy ashva is the sun in respect to the adhyatma paksha the prajapati agni or the purusha the creator is the ashva he is the same as the varuna the most supreme the word medha stands for homage it later on became synonymous with oblations in rituology since oblations are offered dedicated to the one whom we pay mean slaughter or sacrifice the critical and cultural study of the shatapatha brahmana by swami satya prakash saraswati p 415 476 arguing that the animals listed as sacrificial victims are just as symbolic as the list of human victims listed in the purushamedha which is generally accepted as a purely symbolic sacrifice already in rigvedic times other commentators accept the existence of the sacrifice but reject the notion that the queen lay down with the dead horse thus subhash kak in a blog posting suggests that the queen lay down with a toy horse rather than with the slaughtered stallion due to presence of the word ashvaka similar to shivaka meaning idol or image of shiva all world gayatri pariwar since 1991 has organized performances of a modern version of the ashvamedha where a statue is used in place of a real horse according to hinduism today with a million participants in chitrakoot madhya pradesh on april 16 to 20 1994 such without killing it the religious motivation being prayer for overcoming enemies the facilitation of child welfare and development and clearance of debt entirely within the allegorical interpretation of the ritual and with no actual sacrifice of any animal swami dayananda saraswati rejected the classical commentaries of the vedas by sayana mahidhara and uvata as medieval corruptions opposed to the real meaning of the vedas p 443 in order to arrive at an entirely symbolic interpretation of the ritual an empire is like a horse and the subjects like other inferior animals p 448 thus vsm 23 22 literally he beats on the vulva gabha the penis pasas oozes repeatedly ni galgaliti in the receptacle is interpreted not in terms of the horse and the queen but in terms of the king and his subjects the subjects are called gabha to be seized kingly power called pasa this interpretation is apparently based on a verse from shatapatha brahmana according to him no horse was actually to be slaughtered in the ritual as per the yajurveda reception the earliest recorded criticism of the ritual comes from the crvka an atheistic school of indian philosophy that assumed various forms of philosophical skepticism and religious indifference a quotation of the crvka from madhavacharya s sarva darsana sangraha states griffith 1899 omits verses vsm 23 20 amp ndash 31 the ritual obscenities protesting that they are not reproducible even in the semi obscurity of a learned european language alluding to other instances where he renders explicit scenes in latin rather than english a b keith s 1914 translation also omits verses this part of the ritual offended the dalit reformer and framer of the indian constitution b r ambedkar and is frequently mentioned in his writings as an example of the perceived degradation of brahmanical culture while others such has manohar l varadpande praised the ritual as social occasions of great magnitude rick f talbott writes that mircea structure which both regenerated the entire cosmos and reestablished every social order during its performance pixies also pixy pixi pizkie piskies and pigsies as they are sometimes known in cornwall are mythical creatures of folklore considered to be particularly concentrated in the high moorland areas around devon and cornwall suggesting some celtic origin for the belief and name akin to the irish and scottish aos s pixies are believed to inhabit ancient underground ancestor sites such as stone circles barrows dolmens ringfort or menhirs in traditional regional lore pixies are generally benign mischievous short of stature and attractively childlike they are fond of dancing and gather outdoors in huge numbers to dance or sometimes wrestle through the night demonstrating parallels with the cornish plen an gwary and breton fest noz cornish troyl folk celebrations originating in the medieval period in modern times they are usually depicted with pointed ears and often wearing a green outfit and pointed hat sometimes their eyes are described as being pointed upwards at the temple ends these however are victorian era conventions use the term can be synonymous with fairies or sprites however in folklore there is a traditional enmity even war between the two races etymology and origin the origin of the name pixie is uncertain some have speculated that it comes from the swedish dialectal pyske meaning wee little fairy others however have disputed this given there is no plausible case for nordic dialectical survivals in southwest britiain and claiming instead that due to the cornish origin of the piskie that the term is more probably celtic in origin though no direct ancestor of the word is known however the term pobel vean little people is often used to refer to them collectively very similar analogues exist in closely related irish aos si and breton korrigan culture although their common names are unrelated even within areas of language survival there is a very high name for pixie is spriggan this being the area of late survival of the cornish language where spriggan s are distinguished from pixies by their malevolent nature closely associated with tin mining in cornwall are the subterranean ancestral knockers pixie mythology is believed to pre date christian presence in britain in the christian era they were sometimes said to be the souls of children who had died un baptised these children would change their appearance to pixies once their clothing was placed in clay funeral pots used in their earthly lives as toys by 1869 some were suggesting that the name pixie was a racial remnant of pictic tribes who used to paint and tattoo their skin blue an attribute often given to pixies this suggestion is still met in contemporary writing but there is no proven connection and the etymological connection is doubtful some 19th century researchers made more general claims about pixie origins or have connected them with the puck cornish bucca a mythological creature sometimes described as a fairy the advent of more modern fiction pixie mythology was localised to britain some have noted similarities to northern fairies germanic and scandinavian elves but pixies are distinguished from them by the myths and stories of devon and cornwall cornwall and devon before the mid 19th century pixies and fairies were taken seriously in much of cornwall and devon books devoted to the homely beliefs of the peasantry are filled with incidents of pixie manifestations some locales are named for the pixies associated with them in devon near challacombe a group of rocks are named for the pixies said to dwell there at trevose head in cornwall 600 pixies were said to have gathered dancing and laughing in a circle that had appeared upon the turf until one of their number named omfra lost his laugh after searching amongst the barrows of the ancient kings of cornwall on st breock downs he wades through the bottomless dozmary pool on bodmin moor until his laugh is restored by king arthur in the form of a chough real beings persists in the legends associated with dartmoor pixies or piskeys are said to disguise themselves as a bundle of rags to lure children into their play the pixies of dartmoor are fond of music and dancing and for riding on dartmoor colts these pixies are generally said to be helpful to normal humans sometimes helping needy widows and others with housework they are not completely benign however as they have a reputation for misleading travellers being pixy led the remedy for which is to turn your coat inside out the queen of the cornish pixies is said to be joan the wad torch and she is considered to be good luck or bring good luck in devon pixies are said to be invisibly small and harmless or friendly to man in some of the legends and historical accounts they are presented as having near human stature for instance a member of the elford family in tavistock devon successfully hid from cromwells troops in a pixie house house a natural cavern on sheep tor is still accessible at buckland st mary somerset pixies and fairies are said to have battled each other here the pixies were victorious and still visit the area whilst the fairies are said to have left after their loss by the early 19th century their contact with humans had diminished in samuel drews 1824 book cornwall one finds the observation the age of pixies like that of chivalry is gone there is perhaps at present hardly a house they are reputed to visit even the fields and lanes which they formerly frequented seem to be nearly forsaken their music is rarely heard pixie day pixie day is an old tradition which takes place annually in the east devon town of ottery st mary in june the day commemorates a legend of pixies being banished from the town to local caves known as the pixie s parlour the pixie day legend originates from the early days of christianity otteri ottery st mary and commissioned a set of bells to come from wales and to be escorted by monks on their journey on hearing of this the pixies were worried as they knew that once the bells were installed it would be the death knell of their rule over the land so they cast a spell over the monks to redirect them from the road to otteri to the road leading them to the cliff s edge at sidmouth just as the monks were about to fall over the cliff one of the monks stubbed his toe on a rock and said god bless my soul and the spell was broken the bells were then brought to otteri and installed however the pixies spell was not completely broken each year on a day in june the pixies come out and capture the town s bell ringers and imprison them in pixies parlour to be rescued by the vicar of ottery st mary this legend is re enacted each year by the cub and brownie pixies parlour in the town square the original pixie s parlour can be found along the banks of the river otter characteristics pixies are variously described in folklore and fiction they are often described as ill clothed or naked in 1890 william crossing noted a pixie s preference for bits of finery indeed a sort of weakness for finery exists among them and a piece of ribbon appears to be highly prized by them some pixies are said to steal children or to lead travellers astray this seems to be a cross over from fairy mythology and not originally attached to pixies in 1850 thomas keightley observed that much of devon pixie mythology may have originated from fairy myth pixies are said to reward consideration and punish neglect on the part of larger humans for which keightley gives examples by their presence they bring blessings to those who are fond of them pixies are drawn to horses riding them for pleasure and making tangled ringlets in the manes of those horses caves of the ocean the hidden sources of the streams and the recesses of the land some find pixies to have a human origin or to partake of human nature in distinction to fairies whose mythology is traced to immaterial and malignant spirit forces in some discussions pixies are presented as wingless pygmy like creatures however this is probably a later accretion to the mythology one british scholar stated his belief that pixies were evidently a smaller race and from the greater obscurity of the tales about them i believe them to have been an earlier race literary interpretations many victorian era poets saw them as magical beings an example is samuel minturn peck in his poem the pixies he writes t is said their forms are tiny yet all human ills they can subdue or with a wand or amulet can win a maidens heart for you and many a blessing know to stew to make to wedlock the pixies are abroad tonight the late 19th century english poet nora chesson summarised pixie mythology fairly well in a poem entitled the pixies she gathered all the speculations and myths into verse have eer you seen the pixies the fold not blest or banned they walk upon the waters they sail upon the land they make the green grass greener whereer their footsteps fall the wildest hind in the forest comes at their call they steal from bolted linneys they milk the key at grass the maids are kissed a milking and no one hears them pass they flit from byre to stable and ride unbroken foals they seek out human lovers to win them souls the pixies know no sorrow the pixies feel no fear they take no care for harvest or seedtime of the year age lays no finger on them the reaper time goes by the pixies they who change pixies though they love us behold us pass away and are not sad for flowers they gathered yesterday to day has crimson foxglove if purple hose in hose withered last night to morrow will have its rose she touches on all the essentials including even more modern accretions pixies are in between not cursed by god or especially blessed they do the unexpected they bless the land and are forest creatures whom other wild creatures find alluring and non threatening they love humans taking some for mates and are nearly ageless they are winged flitting from place to place the pixie day tradition in samuel taylor coleridges hometown of ottery st mary in east devon was the inspiration for his poem song of the pixies the victorian era writer mary elizabeth whitcombe divided pixies into tribes according to personality and deeds anna eliza bray suggested that pixies and fairies were distinct species modern fiction pixies serve as helpers of santa claus in l frank baum s 1902 and his 1904 short story a kidnapped santa claus they reside in the forest of burzee in michael buckley s the sisters grimm series pixies are described as small orange glowing creatures that resemble fireflies and are controlled by fairies such as puck by the use of a small

in the j m barrie play on which the film is based she is actually a fairy in the disney versions she always uses pixie dust rather than the fairy dust in the play in barrie s original play tinker bell is traditionally staged just as a flying point of light beamed from offstage disney continues to use the terms pixie and fairy interchangeably for tinker bell and associated spin offs in the fairly oddparents the pixies are recurring villains who are dull wear grey suits speak in monotone voices wear pointy caps and unlike the fairies treat magic like a business instead of wands they carry cellphones this is due to them being named after pixels the head pixie h p for short and the other male pixies are not seen pixies also make an appearance in the cartoon winx club in this version it

super deformed in nuclear physics a superdeformed nucleus is a nucleus that is very far from spherical forming an ellipsoid with axes in ratios of approximately 2 1 1 normal deformation is approximately 1 3 1 1 only some nuclei can exist in superdeformed states the first superdeformed states to be observed were the fission isomers low spin states of elements in the actinide and lanthanide series the strong force decays much faster than the coulomb force which becomes stronger when nucleons are greater than 2 5 femtometers apart for this reason these elements undergo spontaneous fission in the late 1980s high spin superdeformed rotational bands were observed in other regions of the periodic table specific elements include ruthenium rhodium palladium silver osmium iridium platinum gold and mercury the existence of superdeformed states occurs because of a combination of macroscopic and microscopic factors which together lower their energies and make them stable minima of energy as a described by the liquid drop model the liquid drop s energy as a function of deformation is at a minimum for zero deformation due to the surface tension term however the curve may become soft with respect to high deformations because of the coulomb repulsion especially for the fission isomers which have high z and also in the case of high spin states because of the increased moment of inertia modulating this macroscopic behavior the microscopic shell correction creates certain superdeformed magic numbers that are analogous to the spherical magic numbers for nuclei near these magic numbers the shell correction creates a second minimum in the energy as a function of deformation even more deformed states 3 1 are called hyperdeformed birthplace boitsfort belgium pierre mertens born 9 october 1939 is a belgian french speaking writer and lawyer who specializes in international law director of the centre de sociologie de la littrature at the universit libre de bruxelles and literary critic with the newspaper le soir influenced by franz kafka mertens started to publish novels and short stories in 1969 and received the prix mdicis in 1987 for les blouissements he nevertheless continued his activities as a lawyer participating in many battles for human rights in 1989 he entered the acadmie royale de langue et littrature de belgique and was also named chevalier de l ordre des arts et des lettres by france mertens has reflected much on the social function of the writer for him private life fiction and history are inseparable thus he grants a central place to the memory in the creation of his works to him the novelist finds his inspiration in their personal and activities of his parents his father a journalist and music lover and his mother a biologist and pianist he was also much affected by the german occupation the execution of the rosenbergs or the tragedy of the miners of marcinelle in 1956 later as a scholar of international law he strongly denounces the genocide in biafra torture in ireland and the prisons of pinochet another important inspiration is music in his novels one finds the influence of music such as the

features like seat belts and their general reluctance to spend money on improving safety it was a pioneering work openly polemical but containing substantial references and material from industry insiders it made nader a household name theme unsafe at any speed is often characterized as the book about the corvair though only one of the book s eight chapters covers the corvair the theme of tire pressures chosen for comfort rather than safety is recurrent and the main theme throughout is the charge that the automobile industry evaded well founded and technically informed criticism organization and content each of the book s chapters covers a different aspect of automotive safety the sporty corvair the subject for which the book is probably most widely known the rear engined chevrolet corvair is this relates to the first 19601964 models that had a swing axle suspension design which was prone to tuck under in certain circumstances in substitution for the cost cutting lack of a front stabilizer bar anti roll bar corvairs required tire pressures which were outside of the tire manufacturer s recommended tolerances the corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential 15psi front 26psi rear when cold 18 psi and 30psi hot and if one inflated the tires equally as was standard practice for all other cars at the time the result was a dangerous oversteer despite the fact that proper tire pressures was more critical than for contemporaneous designs this was not clearly stated to chevrolet salespeople and corvair owners according to the standards laid down by the relevant industry body the tire and rim association the pressures also rendered the front tires overloaded when there were two or more passengers on board an unadvertised at cost option 696 included upgraded springs and dampers front anti roll bars also available such as the empi camber compensator for the knowledgeable owner the suspension was modified for 1964 models with inclusion of a standard front anti roll bar and a transverse mounted rear spring in 1965 the totally redesigned four link fully independent rear suspension maintained a constant camber angle at the wheels corvairs from 1965 were not prone to the formerly characteristic tuck under crashes george caramagna the chevrolet suspension mechanic who nader learned had fought management over omission of the vital anti sway bar that they were forced to install in later models was vital to this issue the missing bar had caused many crashes and it was caramagna who precipitated the whole controversy by staying his ground on the issue disaster deferred chapter 2 levels criticism on auto design elements such as instrument panels and dashboards that were often brightly finished with chrome and glossy enamels which could reflect sunlight or the headlights of oncoming motor vehicles into the driver s eyes this problem according to nader was well known by persons it apart from some of the examples given in the corvair chapter nader offers much about the gear shift quadrants on earlier cars fitted with automatic transmissions several examples are given of persons accidentally being run over or cars that turned into runaways because the driver operating the vehicle at the time of the accident was not familiar with its shift pattern and would shift into reverse when intending to shift to park nader makes an appeal to the auto industry to standardize gearshift patterns between makes and models as a safety issue early automatic transmissions including gm s hydra matic packard s ultramatic and borg warner s automatic used by a number of independent manufacturers rambler studebaker used a pattern of p n d l r which put reverse at the bottom of the quadrant next to low which was contrary to the pattern used by other manufacturers drivers used to moving the shift lever all the way down for low gear would accidentally select r and would unexpectedly move the car backwards in addition push button selector to choose gear ranges ford was the first to use the p r n d l pattern which separated reverse from forward ranges by neutral eventually this pattern became the standard for all automatic shift cars chevrolet s powerglide at least as seen on the corvair used a r n d l pattern which separated the reverse from the drive gears by neutral in the ideal way but which had no p selection relying instead on the process used with a manual transmission of the driver selecting n neutral and using a separate parking brake when parking chapter 2 also exposes problems in workmanship and the failure of companies to honor warranties the second collision chapter 3 documents the history of crash science focusing on the effect on the body the second collision as it collides with the interior of the car as the car hits another object the first collision nader argues that much knowledge was available to designers by the early 1960s but it was largely ignored within the steering assembly instrument panel windshield passenger restraint and the passenger compartment which included everything from door strength to roll over bars due to this the nader bolt was installed to reinforce the door and suicide doors were discontinued because of a lack of door strength the power to pollute chapter 4 documents the automobile s impact on air pollution and its contribution to smog with a particular focus on los angeles the engineers chapter 5 is about detroit automotive engineers general unwillingness to focus on road safety improvements for fear of alienating the buyer or making cars too expensive nader counters by pointing out that at the time annual and unnecessary styling changes added on average about 700 to the consumer cost of a new car this compared to an average expenditure in safety by the automotive companies of about twenty three cents per car the stylists chapter 6 explores the excessive ornamentation that appeared on cars particularly in the late 1950s and the dominance of car nader notes bumpers shaped like sled runners and sloping grille work above the bumpers which give the effect of leaning into the wind increase the car s potential for exerting down and under pressures on the pedestrian see current practice at pedestrian safety through vehicle design the traffic safety establishment subtitled damn the driver and spare the car chapter 7 discusses the way the blame for accidents and fatalities was placed on the driver the book claims that the road safety mantra called the three e s engineering enforcement and education was created by the industry in the 1920s to distract attention from the real problems of vehicle safety such as the fact that some were sold with tires that could not bear the weight of a fully loaded vehicle to the industry he said enforcement and education meant the driver while engineering was all about the road as late as 1965 he noted 320 million federal dollars were allocated to highway beautification while just 500 000 was dedicated to highway safety the concluding chapter suggests that the automotive industry should be forced by government to pay greater attention to safety in the face of mounting evidence about preventable death and injury government response the book has continuing relevance it addressed what nader perceived as the political meddling of the car industry to oppose new safety features which parallels the debates in the 1990s over the mandatory fitting of air bags in the united states and industry efforts by the acea to delay the introduction of crash tests to assess vehicle front pedestrian protection in the european union industry response nader claims that gm responded to his criticism of the corvair by trying to destroy nader s image and to silence him it 1 conducted a series of interviews with acquaintances of the plaintiff questioning them about and casting aspersions upon his political social racial and religious views his integrity his sexual proclivities and inclinations and his personal habits 2 kept him under surveillance in public places for an unreasonable length accosted by girls for the purpose of entrapping him into illicit relationships 4 made threatening harassing and obnoxious telephone calls to him 5 tapped his telephone and eavesdropped by means of mechanical and electronic equipment on his private conversations with others and 6 conducted a continuing and harassing investigation of him on march 22 1966 gm president james roche was forced to appear before a united states senate subcommittee and to apologize to nader for the company s campaign of harassment and intimidation nader later successfully sued gm for excessive invasion of privacy it was the money from this case that allowed him to lobby for consumer rights leading to the creation of the u s environmental protection agency and the clean air act among other things former gm executive john delorean asserted in on a clear day you can see general motors 1979 that nader s criticisms were valid former ford and chrysler president lee iacocca said the corvair was unsafe iacocca an autobiography criticisms of the book the u s department of transportation dot issued a press release dated august 12 1972 setting out the findings of 1971 nhtsa testing after the corvair had been out of production for more than three years the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa had conducted a series of comparative tests in 1971 studying the handling of the 1963 corvair and four contemporary cars a ford falcon plymouth valiant volkswagen beetle renault dauphine along with a second generation corvair with revised suspension design the subsequent 143 page report pb 211 015 available from ntis reviewed a series of actual handling tests designed to evaluate the handling and stability under extreme conditions a review of national accident data compiled by insurance companies and traffic authorities for the cars in the test and a review of related general motors chevrolet internal letters memos tests reports etc regarding the corvair s handling nhtsa went on to contract a three person and competency of their tests this review panel then issued its own 24 page report pb 211 014 available from ntis which concluded that the 1960 63 corvair compares favorably with contemporary vehicles used in the tests the handling and stability performance of the 1960 63 corvair does not result in an abnormal potential for loss of control or rollover and it is at least as good as the performance of some contemporary vehicles both foreign and domestic social scientist thomas sowell argued in the vision of the anointed 1995 that nader was ignorant and dismissive of the trade off between safety and affordability according to sowell nader also did not pay much attention to the fact that motor vehicle death rates per 100 million passenger miles fell over the years from 17 9 in 1925 to 5 5 in 1965 journalist david e davis in a 2009 article in automobile magazine criticized nader for purportedly focusing on the corvair while ignoring other contemporary vehicles with swing axle rear suspensions including cars from porsche center for auto safety had published a book critical of the beetle furthermore motor trend magazine has noted handling problems with the 50 s era mercedes 300sl gullwing journalist timothy noah claimed the car was n t significantly more dangerous than other american cars of its time citing both a government report and an independent report the car was not in fact appreciably less safe than a number of other cars on the market in 2005 the book was named by conservative publication human events as an honorable mention on its list of the most harmful books of the 19th and

heir to the peerage called by john evelyn a youth of extraordinary hopes he completed his education at utrecht and in 1695 entered the house of commons as member for tiverton in the same year he married arabella daughter of henry cavendish 2nd duke of newcastle she died in 1698 and john churchill 1st duke of marlborough and sarah churchill duchess of marlborough this was an important alliance for sunderland and for his descendants through it he was introduced to political life and later the dukedom of marlborough came to the spencers in 1698 he plunged his family into scandal when his brother in law donogh maccarthy 4th earl of clancarty who had been imprisoned in the tower of london for his support for james ii and later escaped was reconciled with his long estranged wife charles sister elizabeth charles alerted by his servants had clancarty arrested the result was a public uproar which gravely embarrassed his parents william iii treated the matter as a trifle wondering why everyone teased him about that little spark clancarty and gave the couple permission to settle in altona hamburg his father s biographer comments that the affair did not show charles in a good light either as man or brother career having succeeded to the peerage in 1702 sunderland was one of the commissioners for he was sent to vienna as envoy extraordinary although he was tinged with republican ideas and had made himself obnoxious to queen anne by opposing the grant to her husband prince george through the influence of marlborough he was foisted into the ministry as secretary of state for the southern department taking office in december 1706 from 1708 to 1710 he was one of the five whigs collectively called the junto who dominated the government but he had many enemies the queen still disliked him and in june 1710 he was dismissed anne offered him a pension of 3000 a year but this he refused saying if he could not have the honour to serve his country he would not plunder it when marlborough protested about the dismissal the queen inquired sarcastically whether the peace of europe must depend on it she added that sunderland was universally unpopular which though a prejudiced view was probably true enough sunderland continued to take part in public life hanover about the steps to be taken in view of the approaching death of the queen he made the acquaintance of george i in 1706 but when the elector became king sunderland only secured the comparatively unimportant position of lord lieutenant of ireland in august 1715 he joined the cabinet as lord privy seal after a visit to george i in hanover he secured in april 1717 the position of secretary of state for the northern department this he retained until march 1718 when he became first lord of the treasury holding also the post of lord president of the council he was now effectively the prime minister sunderland was especially interested in the proposed peerage bill a measure designed to limit the number of members of the house of lords but this was defeated owing partly to the opposition of sir robert walpole in 1719 he was one of the main subscribers in the royal academy of music 1719 a corporation that produced baroque opera on stage the bursting of the had taken some part in launching the scheme of 1720 therefore public opinion was roused against him and it was only through the efforts of walpole that he was acquitted by the house of commons when the matter was investigated in april 1721 he resigned his offices but he retained his influence with george i until his death on 19 april 1722 sunderland inherited his father s passion for intrigue while his manners were repelling but he stands high among his associates for disinterestedness and had an alert and discerning mind from his early years he had a great love of books and he spent his leisure and his wealth in forming the library at althorp which in 1703 was described as the finest in europe in 1749 part of it was removed to blenheim palace sunderland s second wife died in april 1716 after a career of considerable influence on the political life of her time in 1717 he married an irish lady of fortune judith tichborne d

the house of stuart and his death was one of the factors which brought the plot to light the town of sunderland massachusetts was named in his honor in november of 1718 just after he became lord

and later studied at the benedetto marcello conservatory in venice under ernesto rubin de cervin and at darmstadt including being mentored in composition with karlheinz stockhausen he also obtained a degree in medicine from the university of padua and completed a dissertation on criminal anthropology career sinopoli began to make a name for himself as a composer of serial works becoming professor of contemporary and electronic music at the venice conservatoire benedetto marcello in 1972 and a major proponent of the new movement in venice for contemporary music he studied conducting at the vienna academy of music under hans swarowsky and in venice founded the bruno maderna ensemble in the 1970s his single most famous composition is perhaps his opera lou salom which received its first production in munich in 1981 with karan armstrong in the title role and served in this position until 1994 making a number of recordings with them including music by elgar and the complete symphonies of mahler he became principal conductor of the staatskapelle dresden in 1992 he also joined the bayreuth festival s roster of conductors he is best known for his intense and sometimes controversial interpretations of opera especially works by italian composers and richard strauss sinopoli specialized in late nineteenth century and early twentieth century music from wagner and verdi to strauss mahler and the second viennese school his conducting was the object of much controversy especially in the symphonic genre with some berating the eccentricity of his interpretations and even doubting his conducting abilities in norman lebrecht s book the maestro myth lebrecht interviewed many players who had performed under sinopoli who insisted that as a conductor he was actually incompetent while others praised the insightfulness of his often intellectual approach to works on 20 april 2001 sinopoli died of a heart attack while conducting giuseppe verdi s aida performance was dedicated to the memory of the company s late chief director gtz friedrich two nights later marcello viotti stepped in to direct aida and dedicated his performance to sinopoli s memory the funeral in rome on 23 april was attended by the italian president and prime minister as well as a large contingent from la scala he was survived by his wife silvia and two sons his books include masterpieces of greek ceramics from the sinopoli collection he died two days before receiving his laurea in archeology at universit la sapienza in rome sinopoli s last recordings included richard strauss s ariadne auf

soviet self propelled howitzer or assault gun used during world war ii the number 122 in the designation represents the caliber of the main armamenta 122 mm m 30s howitzer the chassis was that of the t 34 development history soviet high command became interested in assault guns following the success of german sturmgeschutz iii spgs assault guns had some advantages over tanks with turrets the lack of a turret made them cheaper to produce they could be built with a larger fighting compartment and could be fitted with bigger and more powerful weapons on a given chassis however assault guns could aim their cannons in high degree only by turning the entire vehicle and were thus less suited for close combat than tanks with turrets in april 1942 design bureaus were asked to develop several assault guns with various armament 76 2 mm zis 3 divisional field guns and 122 mm m 30 howitzers for infantry enemy strongholds a prototype assault gun armed with the 122 mm howitzer and built on the german sturmgeschtz iii chassis was developed designated sg 122 only 10 of these were completed production was halted when the vehicle was found to be hard to maintain and judged to be unsuccessful simultaneously a spg based on the t 34 medium tank was also developed initially the t 34 s chassis was selected for the 76 2 mm f 34 gun this vehicle the u 34 was created in summer 1942 at the design bureau of uztm uralmashzavod uralsky machine building factory by n w kurin and g f ksjunin it was a tank destroyer with the same armament as the t 34 but because of the absence of a turret the vehicle was 70 cm lower had thicker armour and was 2 tonnes lighter it did not enter production uztm then worked on combining features of the u 34 and the sg 122 initial design work was completed between july and august 1942 the project emphasized minimizing modifications to the platform superstructure engine and transmission as the u 34 and was armed with a new 122 mm m 30s howitzer from f f pietrow s design bureau this vehicle also used the same gun bed cover and mountings as the sg 122 to keep costs low and simplify production it had 45 mm thick frontal armour the m 30s howitzer could be elevated or depressed between 3 and 26 and had 10 of traverse the five man crew consisted of a driver gunner commander and two loaders on 25 november 1942 the first u 35 prototype was ready trials ran from 30 november to 19 december 1942 and uncovered various faults in the design including insufficient elevation a flawed shell transfer mechanism poor ventilation for the crew compartment and the fact that the commander had to assist in operating the gun which made him unable to successfully carry out his other duties the u 35 entered service with the red army as the su 35 later renamed su 122 despite these faults production su 122s were based on an improved prototype built after trials were front armour to ease production modified layout of the fighting compartment the location of crew member stations and ammunition racks were changed fewer vision slots and a periscope for the commander the first production vehicles were completed before 1943 production history su 122 production began in december 1942 with 27 vehicles built that month the original plan for production beyond that point was to produce 100 su 122s each month production continued until the summer of 1944 by which time a total of about 1 150 su 122s had been built service history the first su 122s produced in december 1942 were sent to training centers and two new combat units the 1433rd and 1434th self propelled artillery regiments initially each of these mixed regiments consisted of two batteries with four su 122s each and four batteries with four su 76 tank destroyers each each regiment had an additional su 76 tank destroyer as a command vehicle it was planned to raise 30 self propelled artillery regiments operating within armoured and mechanized corps in january 1943 the 1433rd and 1434th leningrad as part of the 54th army on 14 january they saw combat for the first time in smierdny region after that it was decided su 122s should follow between 400 m and 600 m behind the attacking tanks sometimes this distance was shortened to between 200 m and 300 m the use of su 76 tank destroyers together with su 122s proved unsuccessful based on combat experience the organization of self propelled artillery regiments was changed the new regimental organization consisted of two batteries of su 76 tank destroyers and three of su 122s for a total of 20 spgs in april the organization of self propelled artillery regiments was again changed separate regiments were created for su 76 tank destroyers light self propelled artillery regiment and su 122s medium self propelled artillery regiment the medium self propelled artillery regiment consisted of four batteries of four su 122s each each regiment was also equipped with either an additional su 122 or a t 34 for the commander and a ba 64 armoured car this organization remained in place until the beginning of 1944 when the su 122 started to be and su 85 tank destroyers the su 122 proved effective in its intended role of direct fire on strongholds the massive concussion of the 122mm he round was reportedly enough to blow the turret off even a tiger i if a direct hit was scored at close range although longer range penetration against heavier german armor remained poor a trait shared with the larger 152mm howitzers the new bp 460a heat projectile was introduced in may 1943 however its primitive warhead design was only minimally more effective than brute concussive effects of the old he shell at close range at least one su 122 was captured by the german army a small number of su 122s survived the war currently only one example remains on display in the kubinka tank museum variants the su 122 had no variants that went into mass production the t 34 chassis of the su 122 was further adapted as part of the later su 85 self propelled gun towards the end of the production run a prototype su 122 was built with the same ball mantlet as the su 85 as the su 122 was being mass produced its design was being refined primarily with an eye to reduce production costs the m 30s armament proved poorly suited for purpose in spite of its prior recommendation by the gau rkka artillery committee the howitzer took a lot of space and required both commander and gunner to operate it in order to fire because of this in january 1943 work started on fitting the su 122 with a different howitzer the prototype su 122m was built in april 1943 it featured a bigger fighting compartment as well as an individual driver s hatch the m 30s howitzer mounted on the floor of the vehicle was replaced by the more modern d 11 howitzer a variant of u 11 howitzer however the su 122m was not put into production due to a decision to proceed with the su 85 instead su 122 iii another attempt to create an improved su 122 replacement took a su 85 chassis and paired it with the 122 mm d 6 howitzer which was lighter and smaller than the u 11 howitzer this was unsuccessful mechanism and its poor anti tank capabilities subsequent wartime design work on 122 mm self propelled howitzers was cancelled otherlinks prince of wales hospital is a regional acute public hospital located in sha tin new territories in hong kong it is also a

specialist outpatient services in the region sars epidemic in 2003 a severe epidemic severe acute respiratory syndrome sars occurred in multiple countries the epidemic in hong kong started with the outbreak in prince of wales hospital on 10 march 2003 when 11 healthcare workers in ward 8a later renamed 8h had shown symptoms of atypical pneumonia at the same time epidemiologic investigation had linked these cases to a patient who was admitted to ward 8a on 4 march 2003 the patient had previously visited an ill professor from guangzhou the disease was unknown at the time the infection soon spread extensively in ward 8a affecting 143 individuals who had direct contact with the patient including healthcare workers medical students other patients in the same ward visitors and the patients relatives the use nebuliser treatment on the patient in response to the outbreak the hospital had implemented several control measures including restricting access to the 8th floor of the main building where ward 8a was situated suspension of some services and dividing the medical team into a dirty team and a clean team the dirty team led by professor joseph sung was responsible for taking care of sars patients the clean team was barred from the sars wards the outbreak in the hospital eventually affected 239 individuals recent developments the hospital has undergone redevelopment since 2007 the main clinical block and trauma centre a fourteen storey new building was built on the site of the original helipad and tennis court with a total gross floor area of 71 500 square meters the

spanish financier life early life he was born in bayonne france where his father dominique cabarrus fourcade was a merchant and shipbuilder linked to a saga of basque sea captains whalers and adventurers who settled in capbreton a town near bayonne coming from the navarre region of spain there is even a legend in capbreton it is still stated to this day in their tourist brochures that a certain captain cabarrus or gabarrus led a basque whaling expedition to the shores of present day nova scotia in canada in the year 1392 100 years before columbus trip francois was sent to study in toulouse but was recalled to bayonne by his family due to certain amorous adventures and was sent by his father to spain to practice with one of his business correspondents named galabert he not only learned the business but also fell employer s daughter they settled in the town of carabanchel alto near madrid where maria antonia s grandfather had a soap factory their mansion in carabanchel was named maison st pierre in french and many years later this mansion and the lands surrounding it were incorporated into the manor lands of the count of montijo father of the empress eugenia de montijo however he soon began to take an active interest in public matters of the court in nearby madrid the age of enlightenment had reached madrid and king charles iii was favourable to reforms advocated by a circle of politicians including gaspar melchor de jovellanos count campomanes count floridablanca pedro pablo abarca de bolea count of aranda among these cabarrus became conspicuous especially in finance reforms and disgrace he originated a bank the banco de san carlos which is the precursor of today s bank of spain a company to trade with the south american colonies and with asia through and an agricultural and hydraulic project known as the canal de cabarrus which is the origin of today s canal de isabel ii supplying the water to the city of madrid in the northeast of the madrid community in the course of the jarama and within the municipal boundaries of the towns of torrelaguna patones torremocha del jarama uceda and caraquiz he was also involved in at least two other projects involved in the opening of navegable waterways which were never completed one was the canal del guadarrama which was supposed to open a navegable waterway from madrid to the ocean linking several river basins from the guadarrama river up to the guadalquivir river and from there to the sea several ruins of these canals are still visible in the guadarrama river basin area the other project involved the widening of the llobregat river in the province of barcelona in catalua in order to open up the llobregat river valley to shipping and thus give impulse to the future industrial region of catalua with all the on the lemaur brothers for the technical part of the projects he also probably took note of the canal du midi and the canal del languedoc built about a century earlier in france which had given the french such good results by making available a navegable waterway from the atlantic to the mediterranean without having to navigate around spain and avoiding the strait of gibraltar the impulsor of the canal del lanquedoc was pierre paul riquet count of caraman and great grandfather of joseph riquet also count of caraman and later prince of chimay and the last husband of teresa cabarrus galabert the family relationship between several members of the cabarrus family and the lesseps family also originary from bayonne one of whose most notable members was ferdinand de lesseps builder of the suez canal probably also influenced in this canal building impulse as one of the most influential members of the council of finance he had planned many reforms in that department when charles iii died 1788 and the reactionary administration of charles iv put taken an active part in reform were suspected and prosecuted cabarrus himself was accused of embezzlement and thrown into prison in the castle of batres a town near madrid under french domination after two years he was released created a count and employed in stately missions he would even have been sent to paris as spanish ambassador had not the french directory objected to him as being of french birth cabarrus took no part in the maneuvers through which charles iv was obliged to abdicate and make way for joseph bonaparte as king jose i of spain brother of napoleon bonaparte but his french birth and intimate knowledge of spanish affairs recommended him to the emperor as the fittest person for the difficult post of minister of finance which he held at his death he died in seville while on a trip accompanying joseph bonaparte and is buried in the cathedral of seville legacy due to the support he had given joseph bonaparte during his short reign in spain he was considered had already died when ferdinand vii recovered the throne his family was persecuted and his fortune and holdings were confiscated there is even a rumor that states that his remains were removed from his tomb in the cathedral of seville and thrown into the guadalquivir with all of the political turmoil of the following period the heritage he left his heirs was restored and confiscated several times depending on who would be governing in madrid his son heir and second conde de cabarrus domingo cabarrs galabert held several positions in government and was governor of the provinces of palencia and valladolid among other official posts his beautiful daughter teresa cabarrus galabert thrse tallien also madamme tallien afterwards countess of caraman and princess of chimay played a part in the later stages of the french revolution being named as notre dame de buon secours and notre dame de thermidor by her contemporaries one of his grandsons domingo cabarrus quilty married enriqueta kirkpatrick y grivegne sister of manuela kirkpatrick y emperor napoleon iii of france and of the duquesa de alba domingo cabarrus quilty died before his father domingo cabarrus galabert and therefore did not become the third count of cabarrus title that was inherited by his daughter paulina cabarrus kirkpatrick as third countess of cabarrus francisco cabarrus lalanne also acquired the title of viscount of rabouilhet from pedro pablo abarca de bolea count of aranda originally for his other son francisco cabarrus galabert but the early death of this son made him join both titles and up to today the present counts of cabarrus carry also the title of viscounts of rabouilhet the town of rabouilhet and its neighboring towns and countryside also included in the title deed are in the lanquedoc region of france his close friend francisco goya painted a full body portrait of him this portrait is currently exhibited in the bank of spain building in madrid notes infobox aircraft begin infobox aircraft type the mcdonnell douglas md 80 is a family of twin engine short to medium range single aisle commercial jet airliners the md 80 series were lengthened and updated from the dc 9 the airliner family can seat from 130 up to 172 passengers depending on variant and seating configuration the md 80 series was introduced into commercial service on october 10 1980 by swissair the series includes the md 81 md 82 md 83 md 87 and md 88 these all have the same fuselage length except the shortened md 87 the md 80 series was followed into service in modified form by the md 90 in 1995 and the md 95 boeing 717 in 1999 design and development background douglas aircraft developed the dc 9 in the 1960s as a short range companion to their larger dc 8 the dc 9 was an all new design using two rear fuselage mounted turbofan engines and a t tail the dc 9 has a narrow body fuselage design with five abreast seating and holds 80 to 135 passengers depending on seating arrangement and aircraft version the md 80 was originally called the dc 9 80 series and the dc 9 super 80 and entered service in 1980 the md 80 series was then developed into the md 90 entering service in 1995 the last variant of the family was the md 95 which was renamed the boeing 717 200 after mcdonnell douglas s merger with boeing in 1997 the dc 9 family is one of the most successful jet airliners with a total of over 2 400 units produced it ranks third behind the second place airbus a320 family with over 4 000 produced and the first place boeing 737 with over 7 000 produced md 80 series the md 80 series is a mid size medium range airliner that was introduced in 1980 the design was the second generation of the dc 9 with two rear fuselage mounted turbofan engines small highly efficient wings and a t tail the aircraft has distinctive five abreast seating in coach class it was a lengthened dc 9 50 with a higher maximum take off weight mtow and a higher fuel capacity the aircraft series was designed for frequent short haul and seating arrangement the development of md 80 series began in the 1970s as a growth version of the dc 9 series 50 availability of new pratt amp whitney jt8d higher bypass engines drove early studies including designs known as series 55 series 50 re fanned super stretch and series 60 the design effort focused on the series 55 in august 1977 with the projected entry into service in 1980 the design was marketed as the dc 9 series 80 swissair launched the series 80 in october 1977 with an order for 15 plus an option for five the series 80 featured a fuselage 14ft3in m longer than the dc 9 50 the dc 9 wings were redesigned by adding sections at the wing root and tip for a 28 larger wing the initial series 80 first flew october 19 1979 it entered service in 1980 originally it was certified as a version of the dc 9 but was changed to md 80 in july 1983 as a marketing move new versions of the series were initially the certification was dc 9 81 82 etc only the md 88 was given an md certification as was the later md 90 the md 80 versions have cockpit avionics and aerodynamic upgrades along with the more powerful more efficient and quieter jt8d 200 series engines which are a significant upgrade over the smaller jt8d 15 17 11 and 9 series the md 80 series aircraft also have longer fuselages than their earlier dc 9 counterparts as well as longer range some customers such as american airlines still refer to the planes in fleet documentation as super 80 this model is still flown extensively by american airlines and delta air lines comparable airliners to the md 80 series include the boeing 737 400 and airbus a320 in 2012 a freighter version has been created by converting surplus passenger planes flight testing and certification the first md 80 dc 9 line number 909 made its first flight on october 19 1979 test flying despite two aircraft substantially damaged in accidents was completed on august 25 1980 md 81 or dc 9 81 was certificated under an amendment to the faa type certificate for the dc 9 the flight testing leading up to certification had involved three aircraft accumulating a total of 1085 flying hours on 795 flights the first delivery to launch customer swissair took place on september 13 1980 model designation as the md 80 was not in effect a new aircraft it continues to be operated under an amendment to the original dc 9 faa aircraft type certificate a similar case to the later md 90 and boeing 717 aircraft the type certificate issued to the aircraft manufacturer carries the aircraft model designations exactly as it appears on the manufacturer s application including use of hyphens or decimal points and should match what is stamped on the aircraft s data or nameplate what the manufacturer chooses to call an aircraft for marketing or promotional purposes is irrelevant to the airworthiness authorities the first amendment to the dc 9 type certificate for the new md 80 aircraft was applied as dc 9 81 which approved on august 26 1980 amendments to the dc 9 type certificate in 1983 mcdonnell douglas decided that the dc 9 80 super 80 would be designated the md 80 instead of merely using the md prefix as a marketing symbol an application was made to again amend the type certificate to include the md 81 md 82 and md 83 this change was dated march 10 1986 and the type certificate declared that although the md designator could be used in parentheses it must be accompanied by the official designation for example dc 9 81 md 81 all long beach aircraft in the md 80 series thereafter had md 81 md 82 or md 83 stamped on the aircraft nameplate although not certified until october 21 1987 mcdonnell douglas had already applied for models dc 9 87 and dc 9 87f on february 14 1985 third derivative was similarly officially designated dc 9 87 md 87 although no nameplates were stamped dc 9 87 for the md 88 an application for a type certificate model amendment was made after the earlier changes so there never was a dc 9 88 1987 the faa s online aircraft registry database shows the dc 9 88 and dc 9 80 designations in existence but unused production the md 80 was produced on a common line with the dc 9 with which it shares its line number sequence after the delivery of 976 dc 9s and 108 md 80s mcdonnell douglas stopped dc 9 production hence commencing with the 1 085th dc 9 md 80 delivery an md 82 for viasa in december 1982 all dc 9s produced were series 80s md 80s in addition to the long beach california line a second assembly line was set up at shanghai where aircraft were to be built under license during 1991 md 80 production had reached a peak of 12 per month having been running at approximately 10 per month since 1987 and was expected to continue at this rate in the near term 140 md 80s were delivered in 1991 as a result of the decline in the air traffic and a slow market response to the md 90 md 80 production was reduced and 84 aircraft were handed over in 1992 1993 3 5 per month and 22 aircraft were handed over md 80 production ended in 1999 derivative designs the md 90 was developed from the md 80 series and is a 5ftm adj mid updated version of the md 88 with a similar electronic flight instrument system efis glass cockpit and improved and quieter iae v2500 turbofan engines the md 90 program began in 1989 first flown in 1993 and entered commercial service in 1995 a number of other variants were proposed that never entered production one proposal was the md 94x which was fitted with unducted fan turbofan engines previously an md 81 was used as a testbed for unducted fan engines such as the general electric ge36 and the pratt amp whitney allison 578 dx the md 95 was developed to replace early dc 9 models then approaching 30 years old the project completely overhauled the original dc 9 into a modern airliner it is slightly longer than the dc 9 30 and is powered by new rolls royce br715 engines the md 95 was renamed boeing 717 after the md 80 series has been used by airlines around the world major customers have included aerolneas argentinas aeromxico aeropostal aerorepublica alaska airlines alitalia allegiant air american airlines aserca austral lneas areas austrian airlines avianca china eastern airlines china northern airlines delta air lines finnair iberia japan air system jas korean air lion air martinair holland pacific southwest airlines psa reno air scandinavian airlines system sas spanair insel air swissair and trans world airlines due to the usage of the aging jt8d engine the md 80 is not fuel efficient compared to the a320 or newer 737 models it burns 1050usgal l of jet fuel per hour on a typical flight while the larger boeing 737 800 burns only 850usgal l per hour 19 reduction starting in the 2000s many airlines began to retire the type alaska airlines tipping point in using the 737 800 was the 4 per gallon price of jet the airline stated that a typical los angeles seattle flight would cost 2 000 less using a boeing 737 800 than the same flight using an md 80 american airlines has announced plans to retire at least 20 md 80s and has accelerated delivery of new 737 800s while midwest airlines announced on july 14 2008 that it would retire all 12 of its md 80s used primarily on routes to the west coast by the fall the jt8d s comparatively lower maintenance costs due to simpler design help narrow the fuel cost gap variants md 81 the md 81 or as it was originally known the dc 9 super 81 or dc 9 81 was the first production model of the md 80 and apart from the md 87 the differences between the various long body md 80 variants is relatively minor the four long body models md 81 md 82 md 83 and md 88 only differ from each other in having different engine variants fuel capacities and weights the md 88 and later build versions of the other models dimensions the basic long body md 80 versions md 81 md 82 md 83 and md 88 have an overall length of 147ft10 in and a fuselage length of 136ft5 in that is 4 62 m longer than the dc 9 50 and 13 51 m longer than the initial dc 9 the series 10 wingspan was also increased by 4 4 m in comparison with earlier dc 9s at 107ft10 2 in the aircraft s passenger cabin from cockpit door to aft bulkhead is 101ft0 in long and as with all versions of the dc 9 has a maximum cabin width trim to trim of 123 7 in powerplant the initial production version of the md 80 was the pratt and whitney

improvements from mid 1987 new md 87 style low drag beaver tail cones were introduced on all series of md 80s reducing drag and hence improving fuel burn it would seem that some operators have been modifying the old dc 9 style cones on earlier build md 80s to the new low drag style sas is one airline that has done this citing both the improved economics as well as cosmetic improvement for the modification md 81 timeline formal launch october 1977 first flight october 18 1979 faa certification august 25 1980 first delivery september 13 1980 to swissair entry into service october 10 1980

david ervine elected from the belfast north and east constituencies respectively though they proceeded to lose one in the 2003 election leaving ervine as their sole assembly representative this was followed by a poor showing in the northern ireland local election of 2005 where smyth and ervine were their only two members to retain their seats on local authorities and the party now seems to be in a state of decline their position on the left of the political spectrum differentiates them from the other unionist parties such as the ulster unionist party and the democratic unionist party which are ideologically conservative following an intra loyalist feud between the uvf and loyalist volunteer force in which four men were murdered by the uvf in belfast after which recognition of the uvf s ceasefire was withdrawn by the british the uvf but this was defeated in a closed vote at the party s annual conference in october 2005 in march 2006 the chairman of the pup dawn purvis a research associate at the university of ulster was appointed as an independent member of the northern ireland policing board david ervine died following a heart attack on 8 january 2007 on 22 january 2007 dawn purvis was chosen as party leader she is the first woman to lead a unionist party in northern ireland with the exception of anne dickson s short lived leadership of the unionist party of northern ireland after brian faulkner s retirement dr john kyle was co opted on to belfast city council to fill ervine s seat the party did not field any candidates for the 2010 general elections party members were encouraged to vote for a candidate of their choice assembly elections march 2007 the election was for 108 seats spread evenly across 18 constituencies the pup fielded 3 candidates elaine martin in north down andrew park in belfast south polled 3 822 votes or 0 6 of the votes cast in northern ireland down 0 6 from the elections of 2003 dawn purvis was elected to represent belfast east polling

announcing it will keep its weapons and a warning that activities could provoke another generation of loyalists toward armed resistance however the arms decommissioning body has said this did not meet the requirements set out in government legislation the independent international commission on decommissioning iicd urged the uvf rhc to work with it to destroy its weaponry it said it welcomed the statement but was concerned by their intention to deal with their arms without the involvement of the iicd in 2009 the uvf rhc fully decommissioned all their weapons under the supervision of the iicd 2010 resignations in june 2010 dawn purvis resigned as leader and as a member and a recent murder attributed to that group on 28 august 2010 the former deputy leader david rose resigned from the party he cited the recent murder attributed to the uvf and his belief that the party was becoming increasingly conservative in outlook recent activity during a meeting in belfast on 29 september 2010 members of the party agreed to maintain its relationship with the ulster volunteer force and the red hand commando assembly elections may 2011 the election was for 108 seats spread evenly across 18 constituencies the party failed to regain the east belfast seat and are unrepresented in the assembly leader brian ervine resigned soon after the election and was replaced by veteran west belfast activist billy hutchinson in october 2011 notable members former uvf member billy giles whose biography is told in the first chapter of journalist peter taylor s book loyalists having spent 14 years

commando members electoral performance 1997 uk general election 2001 uk general election gabriel 1776 october 10 1800 today commonlyif incorrectlyknown as gabriel prosser was a literate enslaved blacksmith who planned a large slave rebellion in the richmond area in the summer of 1800 information regarding the revolt was leaked prior to its execution and he and twenty five followers were taken captive and hanged in punishment in reaction virginia and other state legislatures passed restrictions on free blacks as well as prohibiting the education assembly and hiring out of slaves to restrict their chances to learn and to plan similar rebellions in 2002 the city of richmond passed a resolution in honor of gabriel on the 202nd anniversary of the rebellion in 2007 governor tim kaine gave gabriel and his followers an informal pardon in recognition that his cause the end of slavery and the furtherance of equality for all peoplehas prevailed in the light of history life and background born into slavery at brookfield a tobacco plantation in henrico county virginia gabriel had two brothers solomon the owner as gabriel and solomon were trained as blacksmiths their father may have had that skill gabriel was also taught to read and write by the mid 1790s as gabriel neared the age of twenty he stood six feet two or three inches high his long and bony face well made was marred by the loss of his two front teeth and two or three scars on his head white people as well as blacks regarded the literate young man as a fellow of great courage and intellect above his rank in life gabriel s rebellion gabriel planned the revolt during the spring and summer of 1800 on august 30 1800 gabriel intended to lead slaves into richmond but the rebellion was postponed because of rain the slaves owners had suspicion of the uprising and two slaves told their owner mosby sheppard about the plans he warned virginia s governor james monroe who called out the state militia gabriel escaped downriver to norfolk for the reward offered by the state that slave did not receive the full reward gabriel was returned to richmond for questioning but he did not submit gabriel his two brothers and 23 other slaves were hanged historiography the historian douglas egerton offered a new perspective on gabriel in his book gabriel s rebellion the virginia slave conspiracies of 1800 amp 1802 1993 he based this on extensive primary research from surviving contemporary documents egerton found that gabriel was a skilled blacksmith who was mostly hired out by his owner in richmond foundries hiring out was the way that slaveholders earned money from their slaves whom they needed less for labor as they had reduced the cultivation of tobacco as a crop the market for tobacco was depressed but virginia planters also had to deal with depleted soils because of the crop slaveholders leased skilled slaves for jobs available in virginia industries egerton concluded that gabriel would have been stimulated and challenged at the foundries by interacting they hoped thomas jefferson s republicans would liberate them from domination by the wealthy federalist merchants of the city in that environment gabriel also would have heard about the uprising and struggles of slaves in saint domingue egerton believed that gabriel had two white co conspirators at least one of whom was identified as a french national he found reports that documentary evidence of their identity or involvement was sent to governor monroe but never produced in court and suggests that it was to protect the jefferson s democratic republican party egerton noted that gabriel did not order his followers to kill all whites except methodists quakers and frenchmen rather he instructed them not to kill any people in those three categories during this period methodists and quakers were active missionaries for manumission and many slaves had been freed since the end of the revolution in part due to their work the french were considered allies as they had abolished slavery in their caribbean colonies in 1794 gabriel initially escaped on a ship owned by a former overseer who repeatedly overlooked information as to gabriel s true identity a slave hired out to work on the ship turned in gabriel seeking the reward so that he could purchase his own freedom the state paid him only 50 not the 300 advertised influence gabriel s uprising was notable not because of its resultsthe rebellion was quelled before it could beginbut because of its potential for mass chaos and widespread violence in virginia in 1800 39 2 percent of the total population were slaves they were concentrated on plantations in the tidewater area and west of richmond no reliable numbers existed regarding slave and free black conspirators most likely the number of men actively involved numbered only several hundred from 1780 to 1810 the number of slaves freed in the upper south had grown markedly as some slaveholders were inspired to free slaves by the american revolution and its ideals methodists and quakers especially worked to convince slaveholders to manumit slaves the percentage of free blacks as part of the black population rose from percent by 1810 by that time virginia s free blacks numbered 30 466 or 7 2 percent of the total black population by 1810 nearly three quarters of delaware s blacks were free some virginia slaveholders were nervous about the sharp increase in the number of free blacks in the slave state they were uneasy as well by the violent aftermath of the french revolution and the uprising of slaves in the 1790s in saint domingue in 1792 france granted social equality to free people of color and in 1793 french revolutionary commissioners in saint domingue granted freedom to all the slaves whites and free people of color some of whom were also slaveholders emigrated as refugees to the us during the years of upheaval now known as the haitian revolution they added to the population of free people of color in charleston richmond and new orleans in addition slaveholders brought thousands of ethnic african slaves with them especially adding to the african population of new orleans in 1804 the black and mulatto revolutionaries succeeded in gaining freedom gabriel had been able to plan the rebellion because of relatively lax rules of movement for slaves between plantations and the city as so many had been hired out and others traveled to and from the city on errands for their masters after the rebellion many slaveholders greatly restricted the slaves rights of travel when not working fears of a slave revolt regularly swept major slaveholding communities prior to the rebellion virginia law had allowed education of slaves to read and write and training of slaves in skilled trades after the rebellion and after a second conspiracy was discovered in 1802 among enslaved boatmen along the appomattox and roanoke rivers the virginia assembly in 1808 banned hiring out of slaves and required freed blacks to leave the state within 12 months or face re enslavement 1806 free blacks had to petition the legislature to stay in the state and were often aided in that goal by white friends or allies in addition to the catalyst of gabriel s rebellion the law against residency people of color in virginia as noted above in manumission of slaves after the american revolution the very existence of free blacks challenged the conditions of slave states legacy and honors gabriel s rebellion served as an important example of slaves taking action to gain freedom in 2002 the city of richmond adopted a resolution to commemorate the 202nd anniversary of the execution of the patriot and freedom fighter gabriel whose death stands as a symbol for the determination and struggle of slaves to obtain freedom justice and equality as promised by the fundamental principles of democratic governments of the commonwealth of virginia and the united states of america in the fall of 2006 the virginia state conference of the naacp requested gov tim kaine pardon gabriel in recognition of his contributions to the civil rights struggle of african americans and all peoples on august 30 2007 governor kaine informally pardoned gabriel and his co conspirators kaine said that gabriel s motivation had been his devotion to the ideals of the american noted that gabriel s causethe end of slavery and the furtherance of equality of all peoplehas prevailed in the light of history and added that it is important to acknowledge that history favorably regards gabriel s cause while consigning legions who sought to keep him and others in chains to be forgotten the pardon was informal because it was posthumous representation in other media arna bontemps wrote black thunder 1936 a historical novel based on gabriel s rebellion songs tim barry a singer songwriter from richmond wrote and performed prosser s gabriel for the album 28th amp stonewall it chronicles the events of gabriel s life focusing on the attempted revolution gabriel is mentioned in public enemy s song prophets of rage gabriel is the hero of a cleverly subversive sea shanty recorded some forty years after events in chapter 17 of frederick marryat s book poor jack 1840 in the book the shanty to its subject as general gabriel and claims a bounty of 1000 was put on his head after being betrayed and captured he is heavily loaded with chains and a troop of light horse is appointed to guard him he is taken before the governor whose name is slightingly alluded to monroe he set up for governor the whole country turns out to see him gabriel makes a last speech in which he proclaims his own right name and that he is here today and gone tomorrow i did not come for to stay for ever he is taken to the gallows in a wagon drawn by four grey horses commenting with heavy irony that the execution was a very sad loss to major prosser the verse concludes by describing gabriel as the man who almost ruined old virginny in the mathematical discipline of linear algebra the schur decomposition or schur triangulation named after issai schur is a matrix decomposition statement the schur decomposition reads as follows if a is a n amp times n square matrix with complex entries then a can be expressed as math a q u q 1 math where q is a unitary matrix so that its inverse q sup 1 sup is also the conjugate transpose q of q and u is an upper triangular matrix which is called a schur form of a since u is similar to a it has the same multiset of eigenvalues and since it is triangular those eigenvalues are the diagonal entries of u of a invariant subspaces 0 v sub 0 sub v sub 1 sub v sub n sub c sup n sup and that there exists an ordered orthonormal basis for the standard hermitian form of c sup n sup such that the first i basis vectors span v sub i sub for each i occurring in the nested sequence phrased somewhat differently the first part says that a linear operator j on a complex finite dimensional vector space stabilizes a complete flag v sub 1 sub v sub n sub proof a constructive proof for the schur decomposition is as follows every operator a on a complex finite dimensional vector space has an eigenvalue amp lambda sub let v sub amp lambda sub sup sup be its orthogonal complement it is clear that with respect to this orthogonal decomposition a has matrix representation one can pick here any orthonormal bases z sub 1 sub and z sub 2 sub spanning v sub amp lambda sub and v sub amp lambda sub sup sup respectively math beginbmatrix z1 amp z2 endbmatrix a beginbmatrixz1 amp z2endbmatrix beginbmatrix lambda ilambda amp a12 0 amp a22 endbmatrix beginmatrix vlambda oplus vlambdaperp endmatrix rightarrow beginmatrix vlambda oplus vlambdaperp endmatrix math where i sub amp lambda sub is the identity operator on v sub amp lambda sub the above matrix would be upper triangular except for the a sub 22 sub block but exactly the same procedure can be applied to the sub matrix a sub 22 sub viewed sub sup sup and its submatrices continue this way n times thus the space c sup n sup will be exhausted and the procedure has yielded the desired result the above argument can be slightly restated as follows let amp lambda be an eigenvalue of a corresponding to some eigenspace v sub amp lambda sub a induces an operator t on the quotient space c sup n sup modulo v sub amp lambda sub this operator is precisely the a sub 22 sub submatrix from above as before t would have an eigenspace say w sub amp mu sub c sup n sup modulo v sub amp lambda sub notice the preimage of w sub amp mu sub under the quotient that contains v sub amp lambda sub continue this way until the resulting quotient space has dimension 0 then the successive preimages of the eigenspaces found at each step form a flag that a stabilizes notes although every square matrix has a schur decomposition in general this decomposition is not unique for example the eigenspace v sub amp lambda sub can have dimension 1 in which case any orthonormal basis for v sub amp lambda sub would lead to the desired result write the triangular matrix u as u d n where d is diagonal and n is strictly upper triangular and thus a nilpotent matrix the diagonal matrix d contains the eigenvalues of a in arbitrary order hence its frobenius norm squared is a while the frobenius norm of a squared is the sum of the squared singular values of a the nilpotent part n is generally not unique either but its frobenius norm is uniquely determined by a just because the frobenius norm of a is equal to the frobenius norm of u d n it is clear that if a is a normal matrix then u from its schur decomposition must be a diagonal matrix and the column vectors of q are the eigenvectors of a therefore the schur decomposition extends the spectral decomposition in particular if a is positive definite the schur decomposition of a its spectral decomposition and its singular value decomposition coincide a of matrices can be simultaneously triangularized i e there exists a unitary matrix q such that for every a sub i sub in the given family q a sub i sub q is upper triangular this can be readily deduced from the above proof take element a from a sub i sub and again consider an eigenspace v sub a sub then v sub a sub is invariant under all matrices in a sub i sub therefore all matrices in a sub i sub must share one common eigenvector in v sub a sub induction then proves the claim as a corollary we have that every commuting family of normal matrices can be simultaneously diagonalized in the infinite dimensional setting not every bounded operator on a banach space has an invariant subspace however the upper triangularization of an arbitrary operator on a complex banach space has a nest of closed invariant subspaces computation schur decomposition of a given matrix is known to be numerically computed by qr algorithm or its variants in other words the roots of the characteristic polynomial corresponding to the matrix are not necessarily computed ahead in order to obtain its schur decomposition conversely qr algorithm can be used to compute the roots of any given characteristic polynomial by finding the schur decomposition of its companion matrix similarly qr algorithm is used to compute the eigenvalues of any given matrix which are the diagonal entries of the upper triangular matrix of the schur decomposition see the nonsymmetric eigenproblems section in lapack users guide applications lie theory applications include every invertible operator is contained in a borel group every operator fixes a point of the flag manifold generalized schur decomposition given square matrices a and b the generalized schur decomposition factorizes both matrices as math a qsz math and and z are unitary and s and t are upper triangular the generalized schur decomposition is also sometimes called the qz decomposition the generalized eigenvalues math lambda math that solve the generalized eigenvalue problem math ax lambda bx math where x is an unknown nonzero vector can be calculated as the ratio of the diagonal elements of s to those of t that is using subscripts to denote matrix elements the i th generalized eigenvalue math lambdai math satisfies math lambdai sii tii math references 14 362474 references constituencywestminster torridge and west devon

and sourton transarmament closely related to civilian based defense is the partial or total replacement of armed forces with the physical and social infrastructure to support nonviolent resistance according to an encyclopedia definition transarmament is the process of changeover from a military based defense policy to a civilian based defense policy transarmament always involves the replacement of one means to provide defense with another it therefore differs from disarmament which is the simple reduction or abandonment of military capacity p 534 civilian defense the term transarmament appears to have been introduced in 1937 in a pamphlet by kenneth boulding it appears not to have been used again until the 1960s according to adam roberts at least four possible stages nowiki of transarmament nowiki can be envisaged 1 research and investigation into civilian defence in order to judge its workability relate it to a specific country s defence problems and develop strategic and tactical concepts so that the proposal can be presented in concrete and practical terms 2 concentrated training of key groups and individuals organizational preparations 3 application of civilian defence in specific areas without complete abandonment of military defence policy 4 public commitment to use civilian defence in resisting all threats formerly dealt with by military methods completion of process of transarment p 338 offensive to defensive transarmament has later been usedfor example by johan galtungas a technical term to describe a shift in military strategy galtung distinguishes between offensive and defense armaments and suggests transitioning to a defensive system of national defense his use of the term does not imply nonviolence cite journal deathplace london harriet cohen cbe 2 december 1895 13 november 1967 was a british pianist biography harriet cohen was born in london and studied piano at the royal academy of music under tobias matthay having won the ada lewis scholarship at the age of 12 followed by the sterndale bennett prize in 1913 she made her debut at a chappell s sunday concert at the queen s hall a year later her first major appearance was in 1920 when she appeared at the wigmore hall in a joint recital with the tenor john coates she became particularly associated with contemporary british music giving the world premiere of ralph vaughan williams piano concerto which was written for her and recording edward elgar s piano quintet with the stratton quartet under the composer s supervision a number of composers wrote music specifically for her including john ireland bla bartk ernest bloch and e j moeran and particularly sir arnold bax cohen s lover who wrote most of his david lean s 1948 film version of oliver twist he also composed concertino for left hand for her after she lost the use of her right hand in 1948 the last six pieces in the collection mikrokosmos by bartk are dedicated to her harriet cohen dedicated an important effort to the performance of the tudor composers at a time when this was unusual and gave recitals of works by william byrd and orlando gibbons and also of henry purcell she was considered one of the finest performers of j s bach s keyboard music winning outstanding praise from the musicologist alfred einstein pablo casals also invited her to play bach with his orchestra at barcelona and wilhelm furtwngler extended a similar invitation on hearing her in switzerland she gave the first all bach recital at the queen s hall in 1925 she also cultivated spanish music and gave the second performance of manuel de falla s nights in the gardens of spain a work an early exponent of music of the soviet union in britain and visited russia in 1935 to broadcast from moscow and leningrad including works by shostakovich kabalevsky and leonid polovinkin these composers later sent her further compositions cohen s influence went well beyond that of a musician she became strongly associated in the 1930s with publicising the plight of german and austrian jews and even played a concert with the scientist albert einstein alfred s cousin in 1934 to raise funds to bring jewish scientists out of germany she became a close friend of eleanor roosevelt and ramsay macdonald as well as the first president of israel chaim weizmann cohen was also a close friend of many leading figures of the time these included not only musicians such as jean sibelius ralph vaughan williams sir edward elgar and sir william walton but also novelists such as arnold bennett george bernard shaw h g wells and d h lawrence as well as politicians or entrepreneurs such as max beaverbrook and leslie viscount runciman cohen her day she was vice president of the women s freedom league and was for several years associated with the jewish national fund and the palestine conservatoire of music at jerusalem cohen was appointed a commander of the order of the british empire cbe in 1938 she died in london the harriet cohen international music award was introduced in her honour in 1951 in january 2006 dearest tania a words and music programme telling the story of cohen premiered written by duncan honeybourne and performed with actress louisa clein efforts for refugees from nazism harriet cohen met the american journalist dorothy thompson in 1930 on her first tour of america a tour which took in new york washington and the library of congress and chicago thus finally establishing a name for herself on the international stage it was a meeting that was to change cohen s life and awake her jewish consciousness in 1933 harriet cohen traveled to vienna to play a number of concerts staying with dorothy thompson both jewish and non jewish who were pouring into the city from germany thompson and cohen were to correspond about the plight of jewish refugees in austria and germany cohen was then able to pass on information from thompson directly to the british prime minister ramsay macdonald who was at this time her intimate friend cohen met thompson every time she went to america thereafter from 1933 cohen committed herself to work in britain and the united states on behalf of refugees this would result in a concert in america with albert einstein in 1934 to raise funds to bring jewish scientists out of germany in 1935 ramsay macdonald warned cohen not to travel through germany because the british government would not be able to provide immunity for her soon after adolf hitler passed the nuremberg laws totally excluding jews from public life harriet cohen had met albert einstein in germany in 1929 when she had afternoon tea at his house at the time einstein disclosed that he played the violin and said that one day they should play he had fled germany in 1933 cohen would often visit him in oxford england where he settled for a short time in 1934 after einstein moved to usa harriet cohen did finally play that duet concert with einstein to raise funds to bring jewish scientists out of nazi germany cohen and einstein remained friends thereafter and he referred to her as the beloved piano witch it was not until 1939 when she first met chaim weizmann the future first president of israel that she began to support the zionist cause and a jewish homeland cohen s 1939 visit to palestine extended her reputation there both as a concert pianist and politically she argued with british and jewish officials to try to get jewish refugees admitted on ships from nazi germany rather than be returned once almost precipitating an international incident harriet cohen believed passionately in a jewish homeland but with justice to the arab palestinians she survived two assassination attempts during her trip to palestine it was when cohen was having dinner with weizmann government s 1939 white paper to limit jewish immigration to britain to just 15 000 people a year blanche dugdale lord balfour s niece a fellow diner prophetically said in an agonised voice what will happen to the millions fleeing from hitler russian composers the visit in spring 1935 by cohen to the soviet union was another major milestone in her career it was the country from which her ancestors had fled 100 years earlier not only was cohen bringing british music to the ussr by playing pieces by vaughan williams bax bliss and ireland she also performed shostakovitch s preludes kabalevsky s sonatina and the soviet premiere of leonid polovinkin s suite from manuscript thereafter she took their music all over europe and was acclaimed as the first musician outside the ussr to learn shostakovitch s twenty four preludes which he composed in 1932 and 1933 her contribution in bringing to the attention of the world the work of unknown russian composers is often forgotten relationship with sir arnold bax one love love without strife or fret or circumstances just the praise to you my mouth longs for your soft mouth these are just two quotes from the love letters between sir arnold bax and harriet cohen harriet cohen s love affair with bax lasted for over forty years until he died in 1953 it was bax who gave harriet cohen the name tania by which she was affectionately known by close friends and family their passionate affair started in 1914 when she was 19 and he was 31 although they had met two years earlier bax was creatively inspired by cohen and in 1915 wrote for her within 13 days three pieces including the princess s rose garden the maiden with the daffodil and in the vodka shop some believe that their time together inspired his famous tone poem tintagel in which he may have in part expressed his anguish at the dream their world denied the affair led to bax s ultimate decision to leave his wife and children in 1918 but they a divorce neither could their relationship be recognised publicly because of the social climate of their generation cohen possibly became pregnant with bax s child in 1919 but if she did she lost the child in an early miscarriage harriet cohen s recently published letters reveal the turbulence and anguish of the relationship cohen always claimed that the long standing affair denied her becoming a dame but this is not substantiated through the 1930s their relationship became less passionate as her international career flourished and bax sought a quieter haven with his gentler mistress mary gleaves nonetheless the affair continued and they remained close as private letters between cohen and bax reveal in 1936 for example they travelled together to stockholm and helsinki and met jean sibelius a composer who had long influenced bax s music on 23 september 1947 bax s wife elsa elsita died cohen probably expected to finally marry bax after an affair that had now lasted 30 years events were to unfold quite differently bax did a fact she was to discover in may 1948 whilst recording the music that bax had written for the film oliver twist when elsa s will was published a greater shock followed when bax revealed his secret twenty year affair with gleaves and his intention not to remarry this was at a time when cohen was losing prominence in britain and in may 1948 cohen had an accident with a tray of glasses which severed the artery in her right hand thus restricting her performing career for some years when bax died on 3 october 1953 cohen was deeply affected by his death his will bequeathed half of his interest from his literary and musical compositions to cohen for life and half to mary gleaves after their death his royalties and estate were to pass to his children cohen also kept the london property that bax had bought for her throughout cohen s life bax had financially assisted her other relationships the british prime minister ramsay macdonald is one of her during the period when he was prime minister from 1929 to 1935 at a time of economic instability and depression which saw the rise of nazism and fascism in europe it was rumoured that macdonald and cohen became lovers their letters reflect a closeness and she often visited him alone at 10 downing street and his home in hampstead certainly many people did believe they were lovers and cohen was often referred to as the old man s darling cohen was also close to max beaverbrook the founder of express newspapers and an important entrepreneur of the day cohen was introduced to the business tycoon max beaverbrook by arnold bennett in 1923 beaverbrook was instantly charmed by cohen and invited her to dine regularly with him from 1923 and through him met lord rothermere and lloyd george beaverbrook and cohen often met at her house as noted in her autobiography a bundle of time he was besotted with her in his own way and showered her regularly with a hundred or more roses ralph his letters to her reveal a flirtatious relationship regularly reminding her of the thousands of kisses that she owed him he was a regular visitor to her home and often attended cohen s little parties that she held for her friends she loved entertaining and inviting famous and prominent people cohen premiered vaughan williams hymn tune prelude in 1930 which he dedicated to her she later introduced the piece throughout europe during her concert tours in 1933 she then premiered his piano concerto in c major a work which was once again dedicated to her cohen was given the exclusive right to play the piece for a period of time harriet cohen first played for edward elgar in 1914 at a party when she was 18 they became close friends and this lasted until his death in 1934 in 1933 cohen organised a concert in his honour under the patronage of the king and queen undoubtedly elgar doted on cohen and closely followed her career giving her constant support under elgar s direction she made quartet elgar had only sketched it but he gave the short score to harriet for the recording h g wells was part of harriet cohen s circle of male admirers from the 1920s after wells parted from writer and novelist rebecca west it is well known that wells took up brief liaisons with other women harriet cohen is highly likely to have been one of these as various letters from her private collection and interviews suggest she had a magnetic personality and beauty which wells found irresistible d h lawrence became a close friend of harriet cohen s it was clear already in 1915 that this friendship had created some tensions between cohen and arnold bax bax protested at cohen s closeness to lawrence she told lawrence that they would have to meet secretly in demonstrative mood that day lawrence scrawled across her autograph book the door closed a short time later cohen contracted tuberculosis possibly from lawrence who died of the disease in 1930 cohen to bax always denied any sexual relationship with lawrence and cohen remained good friends and were regularly seeing each other as least as part of a group of friends up until his death they would often talk together about the music of their common friend the musician elgar cohen was introduced to william walton in 1923 by arnold bennett they carried on a rather flirtatious friendship which cohen described in her autobiography as stormy but delightful she wrote that the irritation they often felt for each other did not lessen the underlying affection cohen championed walton s music both at home and abroad especially in the late 1920s and early 30s on assigning to cohen the premier performance of his sinfonia concertante in 1927 he said to her i know it will be in safe hands rosa newmarch introduced harriet cohen to jean sibelius in london 1921 and they spent some time together in the summer 1936 cohen travelled in finland with arnold bax and they had long discussions with sibelius both in helsinki and ainola sibelius even wrote her the opening chord of his eight symphony which was probably with arnold bennett arnold bennett dear friend and mentor of my youth died on 27 march 1931 wrote cohen in her autobiography arnold bennett was one of cohen s closest friends and responsible for introducing her to many of her new friends bennett introduced cohen to william walton and max beaverbrook in 1923 cohen was devastated on bennett s sudden death from typhoid fever on 27 march 1931 she had spoken to him only a few days earlier when he had told her how unwell he was feeling it was bennett who had kept cohen on the rails for over a decade giving her honest blunt necessary advice cohen listened to him and respected his judgement he had guided her when she was in her 20s when her reputation and fame was growing both at home and abroad cohen in novels harriet cohen was portrayed in three novels d h lawrence based the main character of harriet in his novel kangaroo on cohen kangaroo was rebecca west

printing 151 152 a flashtube also called a flashlamp is an electric arc lamp designed to produce extremely intense incoherent full spectrum white light for very short durations flashtubes are made of a length of glass tubing with electrodes at either end and are filled with a gas that when triggered ionizes and conducts a high voltage pulse to produce the light flashtubes are used mostly for photographic purposes but are also employed in scientific medical and industrial applications construction the lamp comprises a hermetically sealed glass tube which is filled with a noble gas usually xenon and electrodes to carry electrical current to the gas additionally a high voltage power source is necessary to energize the gas a charged capacitor is usually used for this purpose so as to allow very speedy delivery of very high electrical current when the lamp is triggered glass envelopes the glass envelope is most commonly a thin tube often made of fused quartz borosilicate or pyrex which may be straight including helical u shape and circular to surround a camera lens for shadowless photography ring flashes in some applications the emission of ultraviolet light is undesired whether due to production of ozone damage to laser rods degradation of plastics or other detrimental effects in these cases a doped fused silica is used doping with titanium dioxide can provide different cutoff wavelengths on the ultraviolet side but the material suffers from solarization it is often used in medical and sun ray lamps and some non laser lamps a better alternative is a cerium doped quartz it does not suffer from solarization and has higher efficiency as part of the absorbed ultraviolet is reradiated as visible via fluorescence its cutoff is at about 380 nm conversely when ultraviolet is called for a synthetic quartz is used as the envelope it is the most expensive of the materials but it is not susceptible to solarization and its cutoff is at 160 nm the power level of the lamps is rated in watts area cooling of the electrodes and the lamp envelope is of high importance at high power levels air cooling is sufficient for lower average power levels high power lamps are cooled with a liquid typically by flowing demineralized water through a tube in which the lamp is encased water cooled lamps will generally have the glass shrunk around the electrodes to provide a direct thermal conductor between them and the cooling water the cooling medium should flow also across the entire length of the lamp and electrodes high average power or continuous wave arc lamps must have the water flow across the ends of the lamp and across the exposed ends of the electrodes as well so the deionized water is used to prevent a short circuit above 15 w cm sup 2 sup forced air cooling is required liquid cooling if in a confined space liquid cooling is generally necessary above 30 w cm sup 2 sup thinner walls can survive higher average power loads due to lower mechanical strain across the thickness of the material which is caused by a e g 1 mm thick doped quartz has limit of 160 w cm sup 2 sup 0 5 mm thick one has limit of 320 w cm sup 2 sup for this reason thinner glass is often used for continuous wave arc lamps thicker materials can generally handle more impact energy from the shock wave that a short pulsed arc can generate so quartz as much as 1 mm thick is often used in the construction of flashtubes the material of the envelope provides another limit for the output power 1 mm thick fused quartz has a limit of 200 w cm sup 2 sup synthetic quartz of same thickness can run up to 240 w cm sup 2 sup aging lamps require some derating due to increased energy absorption in the glass due to solarization and sputtered deposits electrodes and seals the electrodes protrude into each end of the tube and are sealed to the glass using a few different methods ribbon seals use thin strips of molybdenum foil bonded directly to the glass which are very durable but are solder seals bond the glass to the electrode with a solder for a very strong mechanical seal but are limited to low temperature operation most common in laser pumping applications is the rod seal where the rod of the electrode is wetted with another type of glass and then bonded directly to a quartz tube this seal is very durable and capable of withstanding very high temperature and currents the seal and the glass must have the same coefficient of expansion for low electrode wear the electrodes are usually made of tungsten which has the highest melting point of any metal to handle the thermionic emission of electrons cathodes are often made from porous tungsten filled with a barium compound which gives low work function the structure of cathode has to be tailored for the application anodes are usually made from pure tungsten or when good machinability is required lanthanum alloyed tungsten and are often machined to provide extra surface area to cope with power loading dc arc lamps often have a cathode with from the glass and to control temperature flashtubes usually have a cathode with a flattened radius to reduce the incidence of hot spots and decrease sputter caused by peak currents which may be in excess of 1000 amperes electrode design is also influenced by the average power at high levels of average power care has to be taken to achieve sufficient cooling of the electrodes while anode temperature is of lower importance overheating the cathode can greatly reduce the lamp s life expectancy gases and fill pressure depending on the size type and application of the flashtube gas fill pressures may range from a few kilopascals to hundreds of kilopascals 0 014 0 atmospheres or tens to thousands of torr generally the higher the pressure the greater the output efficiency xenon is used mostly because of its good efficiency converting nearly 50 of electrical energy into light krypton on the other hand is only about 40 efficient but at low currents is a better match to the absorption is the amount of gas behind the electrodes or the dead volume a higher dead volume leads to a lower pressure increase during operation operation the electrodes of the lamp are usually connected to a capacitor which is charged to a relatively high voltage generally between 250 and 5000 volts using a step up transformer and a rectifier the gas however exhibits extremely high resistance and the lamp will not conduct electricity until the gas is ionized once ionized or triggered a spark will form between the electrodes allowing the capacitor to discharge the sudden surge of electric current quickly heats the gas to a plasma state where electrical resistance becomes very low there are several methods of triggering external triggering external triggering is the most common method of operation especially for photographic use the electrodes are charged to a voltage high enough to respond to triggering but below the lamp s self flash threshold an extremely high voltage pulse usually between 2000 applied directly to or very near the glass envelope water cooled flashtubes sometimes apply this pulse directly to the cooling water and often to the housing of the unit as well so care must be taken with this type of system the short high voltage pulse creates a rising electrostatic field which ionizes the gas inside the tube the capacitance of the glass couples the trigger pulse into the envelope where it exceeds the breakdown voltage of the gas surrounding one or both of the electrodes forming spark streamers the streamers propagate via capacitance along the glass at a speed of 1 centimeter in 60 nanoseconds 170 km s a trigger pulse must have a long enough duration to allow one streamer to reach the opposite electrode or erratic triggering will result the triggering can be enhanced by applying the trigger pulse to a reference plane which may be in the form of a metal band or reflector affixed to the glass a conductive paint or a thin wire capacitor voltage is greater than the voltage drop between the cathode and the anode when the internal spark streamers bridge the electrodes the capacitor will discharge through the ionized gas heating the xenon to a high enough temperature for the emission light series triggering series triggering is more common in high powered water cooled flashtubes such as those found in lasers the high voltage leads of the trigger transformer are connected to the flashtube in series one lead to an electrode and the other to the capacitor the trigger pulse forms a spark inside the lamp without exposing the trigger voltage to the outside of the lamp the advantages are better insulation more reliable triggering and an arc that tends to develop well away from the glass but at a much higher cost the series triggering transformer also acts as an inductor this helps to control the flash duration but prevents the circuit from being used in very fast discharge applications the triggering can generally take place with a lower voltage at the trigger transfromer becomes part of the flash circuit and couples the triggering circuit to the flash energy therefore because the trigger transformer has very low impedance the transformer triggering circuit and silicon controlled rectifier scr must be able to handle very high peak currents often in excess of 1500 amps simmer voltage triggering simmer voltage triggering is the least common method in this technique the capacitor voltage is not initially applied to the electrodes but instead a high voltage spark streamer is maintained between the electrodes the high current from the capacitor is delivered to the electrodes using a thyristor or a spark gap this type of triggering is used mainly in very fast rise time systems typically those that discharge in the microsecond regime such as used in high speed stop motion photography or dye lasers the simmering spark streamer causes the arc to develop in the exact center of the lamp increasing the lifetime dramatically if external triggering is used the spark streamers may still be in through the tube causing wall ablation or in extreme cases cracking or even explosion of the lamp however because very short pulses often call for very high voltage and low capacitance keeping the current density from rising too high some microsecond flashtubes are triggered by simply over volting that is by applying a voltage to the electrodes which is much higher than the lamp s self flash threshold using a spark gap often a combination of simmer voltage and over volting is used prepulse techniques very rapid rise times are often achieved using a prepulse technique this method is performed by delivering a small flash through the lamp just before the main flash this flash is of much lower energy than the main flash typically less than 10 and depending on the pulse duration is delivered just a few thousandths to a few millionths of a second before the main flash the prepulse heats the gas leaving a good quantity of ionized particles to be used by the main flash this wave and makes less noise during operation vastly increasing the lifetime of the lamp it is especially effective on very fast discharge applications allowing the arc to expand faster and better fill the tube it is very often used with simmer voltage and sometimes with series triggering but rarely used with external triggering prepulse techniques are most commonly used in the pumping of dye lasers greatly increasing the conversion efficiency however it has also been shown to increase the efficiency of other lasers with longer fluorescence lifetimes allowing longer pulses such as nd yag or titanium sapphire by creating pulses with almost square waveforms ablative flashtubes ablative flashtubes are triggered by under pressurizing ablative flashtubes are typically constructed using quartz tubing and one or both electrodes hollowed out allowing a vacuum pump to be attached to control the gas pressure the electrodes of the lamp are connected to a charged capacitor and then the gas is vacuumed from the lamp when the gas reaches a low enough pressure often just a low pressures the efficiency of the flash would normally be very low however because of the low pressure the particles have room to accelerate to very high speeds and the magnetic forces expand the arc so that the bulk of its pasma becomes concentrated at the surface bombarding the glass the bombardment ablates vaporizes large amounts of quartz from the inner wall this ablation creates a sudden violent increase in the internal pressure of the lamp increasing the efficiency of the flash to very high levels the ablation however causes extensive wear to the lamp weakening the glass and they typically need replacement after a very short lifetime ablative flashtubes need to be refilled and vacuumed to the proper pressure for each flash therefore they can not be used for very high repetition applications also this usually precludes the use of very expensive gases like krypton or xenon the most common gas used in an ablative flashtube is air although sometimes cheap argon is also used the heat from transferring to the glass but the flashes can often be shorter than a normal lamp of comparative size the flash from a single ablative flashtube can also be more intense than multiple lamps for these reasons the most common use for the lamps is for the pumping of dye lasers variable pulse width control in addition an insulated gate bipolar transistor igbt can be connected in series with both the trigger transformer and the lamp making adjustable flash durations possible an igbt used for this purpose must be rated for a high pulsed current so as to avoid over current damage to the semiconductor junction this type of system is used frequently in high average power laser systems and can produce pulses ranging from 500 microseconds to over 20 milliseconds it can be used with any of the triggering techniques like external and series and can produce square wave pulses it can even be used with simmer voltage to produce a modulated continuous wave output with repetition rates over 300 hertz several kilowatts of average power output can be obtained electrical requirements the electrical requirements for a flashtube can vary depending on the desired results the usual method once maximum power and the safe amount of operating energy is determined is to pick a current density that will emit the desired spectrum and let the lamp s resistance determine the necessary combination of voltage and capacitance to produce it the resistance in flashtubes varies greatly depending on pressure shape dead volume current density time and flash duration and therefore is usually referred to as impedance the most common symbol used for lamp impedance is k sub o sub which is expressed as ohms amps sup 0 5 sup k sub o sub is determined by the internal diameter arc length and gas type of the lamp and to a lesser extent by fill pressure the resistance in flashtubes is not constant but quickly drops as current density increases in 1965 goncz showed that square root of current density as the arc develops the lamp experiences a period of negative resistance causing the resistance to decrease as the current increases this occurs until the plasma comes into contact with the inner wall when this happens the voltage becomes proportional to the square root of current and the resistance in the plasma becomes stable for the remainder of the flash it is this value which is defined as k sub o sub however as the arc develops the gas expands and calculations for k sub o sub do not take into account the dead volume which leads to a lower pressure increase therefore any calculation of k sub o sub is merely an approximation of lamp impedance output spectrum xenon a xenon flash lamp is a gas discharge lamp that contains xenon gas these lamps have three leads an anode a cathode and a trigger voltage lead when a certain voltage is applied to the trigger lead xenon gas ionizes and displays a bright voltage is applied across the anode and cathode leads xenon gas will not ionize the use of a xenon flash lamp may be suitable for photographing or lightning projects as with all ionized gases xenon flashtubes emit light in various spectral lines this is the same phenomenon that gives neon signs their characteristic color however neon signs emit red light because of extremely low current densities when compared to those seen in flashtubes which favors spectral lines of longer wavelengths higher current densities tend to favor shorter wavelengths the light from xenon in a neon sign likewise is rather violet the spectrum emitted by flashtubes is far more dependent on current density than on the fill pressure or gas type low current densities produce spectral line emission against a faint background of continuous radiation xenon has many spectral lines in the uv blue green red and ir portions of the spectrum low current densities produce a greenish blue flash indicating the absence of significant yellow or orange lines at be directed into the invisible ir spectral lines around 820 900 and 1000 nm low current densities for flashtubes are generally less than 1000 a cm sup 2 sup higher current densities begin to produce continuum emission spectral lines are less dominant as light is produced across the spectrum usually peaking or centered on a certain wavelength optimum output efficiency in the visual range is obtained at a density that favors greybody radiation an arc that produces mostly continuum emission but is still mostly transparent to its own light for xenon greybody radiation is centered near green and produces the right combination for white light greybody radiation is produced at densities above 2400 a cm sup 2 sup current densities that are very high approaching 4000 a cm sup 2 sup tend to favor black body radiation as current densities become even higher xenon s output spectrum will begin to settle on that of a blackbody radiator with a color temperature of 9800 kelvins a rather sky blue shade of white blackbody radiation from within the arc can be absorbed before reaching the surface impairing output efficiency due to its high efficient white output xenon is used extensively for photographic applications despite its great expense in lasers spectral line emission is usually favored as these lines tend to better match absorption lines of the lasing media krypton is also occasionally used although it is even more expensive at low current densities krypton s spectral line output in the near ir range is better matched to the absorption profile of neodymium based laser media than xenon emission and very closely matches the narrow absorption profile of nd yag krypton and other gases all gases produce spectral lines which are specific to the gas superimposed on a background of continuum radiation with all gases low current densities produce mostly spectral lines with the highest output being concentrated in the near ir between 650 and 1000 nm krypton s strongest peaks are around 760 and 810 nm argon has many strong peaks at 670 710 760 peaks around 650 700 850 and 880 nm as current densities become higher the output of continuum radiation will increase more than the spectral line radiation at a rate 20 greater and output center will shift toward the visual spectrum at greybody current densities there is only a slight difference in the spectrum emitted by various gases at very high current densities all gases will begin to operate as blackbody radiators with spectral outputs centered in the near uv heavier gases exhibit higher resistance and therefore have a higher value for k sub o sub impedance being defined as the resistance required to change energy into work is higher for heavier gases and as such the heavier gases are much more efficient than the lighter ones helium and neon are far too light to produce an efficient flash krypton can be as good as 40 efficient but requires up to a 70 increase in pressure to achieve this argon can be up to 30 efficient but requires an even voltage drop between the electrodes formed by the spark streamer may be greater than the capacitor voltage these lamps often need a boost voltage during the trigger phase to overcome the extremely high trigger impedance nitrogen in the form of air has been used in flashtubes in home made dye lasers but the nitrogen and oxygen present form chemical reactions with the electrodes and themselves causing premature wear and the need to adjust the pressure for each flash some research has been done on mixing gases to alter the spectral output the effect on the output spectrum is negligible but the effect on efficiency is great adding a lighter gas will only reduce the efficiency of the heavier one light production as the current pulse travels through the tube it ionizes the atoms causing them to jump to higher energy levels three types of particles are found within the arc plasma consisting of electrons positively ionized atoms and neutral atoms at any given time the ionized produce all of the emitted light as they recombine with their lost electrons they immediately drop back to a lower energy state releasing photons in the process the methods of transferring energy occur in three separate ways called bound bound free bound and free free transitions within the plasma positive ions move toward the cathode while electrons and neutral atoms move toward the anode bound bound transitions occur when the ions and neutral atoms collide transferring an electron from the atom to the ion this method predominates at low current densities and is responsible for producing the spectral line emission free bound transitions happen when an ion captures a free electron this method produces the continuum emission and is more prominent at higher current densities some of the continuum is also produced when an electron accelerates toward an ion called free free transitions producing bremsstrahlung radiation intensity and duration of flash the only real electrical limit to how short a pulse can be is the total system inductance including that of the capacitor wires be minimized this is typically done using special capacitors the shortest wires available and electrical leads with a lot of surface area but thin cross sections for extremely fast systems low inductance axial leads such as copper tubing plastic core wires or even hollowed electrodes may be used to decrease the total system inductance dye lasers need very short pulses and sometimes use axial flashtubes which have an annular shape with a large outer diameter ring shaped electrodes and a hollow inner core allowing both lower inductance and a dye cell to be placed like an axle through the center of the lamp in contrast changes in the input voltage or capacitance have no effect on discharge time although they do have an effect on current density as flash duration decreases the electrical energy becomes concentrated into shorter pulses so the current density will increase compensating for this usually requires lowering the capacitance as pulse duration decreases and then raising the voltage proportionately in order to maintain a high enough energy level however as pulse the lamp so the energy level must also be decreased to avoid destroying the lamp the amount of power loading the glass can handle is the major mechanical limit even if the amount of energy joules that is used remains constant electrical power wattage will increase in inverse proportion to a decrease in discharge time therefore energy must be decreased along with the pulse duration to keep the pulsed power levels from rising too high quartz glass 1 millimeter thick per 1 second discharge can usually withstand a maximum of 160 watts per square centimeter of internal surface area other glasses have a much lower threshold extremely fast systems with inductance below critical damping 0 8 microhenries usually require a shunt diode across the capacitor to prevent current reversal ringing from destroying the lamp if the pulse is allowed to ring through the lamp it will lengthen the flash so the diode traps the ringing allowing the lamp shut down at the correct time the limits to the anode sputter caused by ion bombardment at the cathode and the temperature gradients of the glass pulses that are too long can vaporize large amounts of metal from the cathode while overheating the glass will cause it to crack lengthwise for continuous operation the cooling is the limit discharge durations for common flashtubes range from 1 microsecond to tens of milliseconds and can have repetition rates of hundreds of hertz flash duration can be carefully controlled with the use of an inductor the flash that emanates from a xenon flashtube may be so intense that it can ignite flammable materials within a short distance of the tube carbon nanotubes are particularly susceptible to this spontaneous ignition when exposed to the light from a flashtube similar effects may be exploited for use in aesthetic or medical procedures known as intense pulsed light ipl treatments ipl can be used for treatments such as hair removal and destroying lesions or moles lifetime the lifetime of a flashtube depends on both the energy level used for the the pulse duration of the lamp failures can be catastrophic causing the lamp to shatter or they can be gradual reducing the performance of the lamp below a usable rating catastrophic failure catastrophic failure can occur from two separate mechanisms energy and heat when too much energy is used for the pulse duration structural failure of the glass envelope can occur flashtubes produce an electrical arc flash contained in a glass tube as the arc develops a supersonic shock wave forms traveling radially from the center of the arc and impacting the inner wall of the tube if the energy level is low enough a soft tap against the glass is all that will be heard however if the energy level used equals the explosion energy rating of the lamp the impacting shock wave will fracture the glass rupturing the tube the resulting explosion creates a loud sonic shock wave and may throw shattered glass several feet the explosion energy is calculated by multiplying the internal surface area of the lamp the glass power loading is determined by the type and thickness of the glass and the cooling method that is used power loading is measured in watts per centimeter squared however since the pulsed power level increases as the flash duration decreases the explosion energy must then be decreased in direct proportion to the square root of discharge time failure from heat is usually caused by excessively long pulse durations or high average power levels when the inner wall of the tube gets too hot while the outer wall is still cold this temperature gradient can cause the lamp to crack similarly if the electrodes heat much faster than the glass the lamp may crack or even shatter at the ends gradual failure the closer a flashtube operates to its explosion energy the greater the risk becomes for catastrophic failure at 50 of the explosion energy the lamp may produce several thousand flashes before exploding at 60 of the explosion energy the lamp will usually fail in less than a hundred energy the risk of catastrophic failure becomes very low the methods of failure then become those that reduce the output efficiency and affect the ability to trigger the lamp the processes affecting these are sputter and ablation of the inner wall sputter occurs when the energy level is very low below 15 of the explosion energy or when the pulse duration is very long sputter is the vaporization of metal from the cathode which is redeposited on the walls of the lamp blocking the light output since the cathode is more emissive than the anode the flashtube is polarized and connecting the lamp to the power source incorrectly will quickly ruin it however even if connected properly the degree of sputter may vary considerably from lamp to lamp therefore it is impossible to predict the lifetime accurately at low energy levels at higher energy levels wall ablation becomes the main process of wear the electrical arc slowly erodes the inner wall of the tube forming microscopic cracks that give the glass glass increasing the pressure beyond an operable level this causes triggering problems known as jitter however at higher energy levels the lifetime can be calculated with a fair degree of accuracy when operated below 30 of the explosion energy flashtube lifetime is generally between a few million to tens of millions of flashes applications as the duration of the flash that is emitted by a xenon flashtube can be accurately controlled and due to the high intensity of the light xenon flashtubes are commonly used as photographic strobe lights xenon flashtubes are also used in very high speed or stop motion photography which was pioneered by harold edgerton in the 1930s because they can generate bright attention getting flashes with a relatively small continuous input of electrical power they are also used in aircraft warning lights emergency vehicle lighting fire alarm annunciator devices horn lights aircraft anticollision beacons and other similar applications in dentistry it is used in so called light box device to light activate materials for example megaflash mini uni xs and other devices due to their high intensity and relative brightness at short wavelengths extending into the ultraviolet and short pulse widths flashtubes are also ideally suited as light sources for pumping atoms in a laser to excited states where they can subsequently be stimulated to emit coherent monochromatic light proper selection of the filler gas is crucial here so the maximum of radiated output energy is concentrated in the bands that are the best absorbed by the lasing medium e g krypton flashtubes are more suitable than xenon flashtubes for pumping nd yag lasers as krypton emission in near infrared is better matched to the absorption spectrum of nd yag xenon flashtubes have been used to produce an intense flash of white light some of which is absorbed by nd glass that produces the laser power for inertial confinement fusion in total about 1 to 1 5 of the electrical power fed into the flashtubes is turned into useful laser light for this application history the flashtube was invented by harold edgerton in moving objects flashtubes were mainly used for strobe lights in scientific studies but eventually began to take the place of chemical and powder flash lamps in mainstream photography early high speed photographs were taken with an open air electrical arc discharge called spark photography the earliest known use of spark photography began with henry fox talbot around 1850 in 1886 ernst mach used an open air spark to photograph a speeding bullet revealing the shockwaves it produced at supersonic speeds open air spark systems were fairly easy to build but were bulky very limited in light output and produced loud noises comparable to that of a gunshot in 1927 harold edgerton built his first flash unit while at massachusetts institute of technology wanting to photograph the motion of a motor in vivid detail without blur edgerton decided to improve the process of spark photography by using a mercury arc rectifier instead of an open air discharge to produce the light he was able to achieve a flash duration of 10 microseconds and was able to his colleague s interest in the new flash apparatus soon provoked edgerton to improve upon the design the mercury lamp s efficiency was limited by the coolest part of the lamp causing them to perform better when very hot but poorly when cold edgerton decided to try a noble gas feeling that it would not be as temperature dependent as mercury and in 1930 he employed the general electric company to construct some lamps using argon instead the argon tubes were much more efficient compact and could be mounted near a reflector concentrating their output slowly camera designers began to take notice of the new technology and began to accept it edgerton received his first major order for the strobes from the kodak company in 1940 afterward he discovered that xenon was the most efficient of the noble gases producing a spectrum very close to that of daylight and xenon flashtubes became standard in most large photography sets it was not until the 1970s that strobe units became portable enough to use invented the ruby laser a new demand for flashtubes began for use in lasers and new interest was taken in the study of the lamps safety flashtubes operate at high voltages with currents high enough to be deadly under certain conditions shocks as low as 1 joule have been reported to be lethal the energy stored in a capacitor can remain surprisingly long after power has been disconnected a flashtube will usually shut down before the capacitor has fully drained and it may regain part of its charge through a process called dielectric absorption in addition the charging system itself can be equally deadly the trigger voltage can deliver a painful shock usually not enough to kill but which can often startle a person into bumping or touching something more dangerous when a person is charged to high voltages a spark can jump delivering the high capacitor current without actually touching anything flashtubes operate at high pressures and are known to explode producing violent shockwaves the explosion energy of a in just a few flashes is well defined and to avoid catastrophic failure it is recommended that no more than 30 of the explosion energy be used flashtubes should be shielded behind glass or in a reflector cavity if not eye and ear protection should be worn flashtubes produce very intense flashes often faster than the eye can register and may not appear as bright as they are quartz glass will transmit nearly all of the long and short wave uv including the germicidal wavelengths and can be a serious hazard to eyes and skin this ultraviolet radiation can also produce large amounts of ozone which can be harmful to people animals and equipment many compact cameras charge the flash capacitor immediately after power up and some even just by inserting the batteries merely inserting the battery into the camera can prime the capacitor to become dangerous or at least unpleasant for up to several days the energy involved is also fairly significant a 330 microfarad capacitor charged to 300 volts 15 joules of energy popular culture in the 1969 book the andromeda strain and the 1971 motion picture specialized exposure to a xenon flash apparatus was used to burn off the outer epithelial layers of human skin as an antiseptic measure

the village of stoke mandeville was badly affected by cholera epidemics that swept across england a cholera hospital was established on the parish border between stoke mandeville and aylesbury it was

century the hospital infections not just cholera however the town of aylesbury was growing and the distance between the town and the hospital was getting smaller and before long people with infectious diseases could no longer be treated at the hospital because the risk of infecting the local community was too great during the second world war the hospital was used to treat military casualties and was expanded during this time to cater for the extra patients so as to support the nearby royal bucks hospital in the centre of aylesbury it was during this time that spinal injuries were first treated at the hospital in 1948 the nhs was founded and all operations were moved from the royal bucks to stoke mandeville making it the main hospital in aylesbury aylesbury had by this time grown to such an extent that the hospital became a part of the town on the day of the opening of the 1948 summer olympics in london stoke mandeville hospital organised a sports competition for british world war two veteran patients with spinal same location in 1952 and dutch veterans took part alongside the british making it the first international competition of its kind these stoke mandeville games have been described as the precursors of the paralympic games the paralympics were subsequently officialised as a quadrennial event tied to the olympic games and the first official paralympic games no longer open solely to war veterans were held in rome in 1960 throughout the 1950s 1960s and 1970s the hospital was added to extensively and the new accident and emergency unit was opened also during this period stoke mandeville stadium was developed alongside the hospital and is the national centre for disability sport in the united kingdom enhancing the hospital as a world centre for paraplegics and spinal injuries in the 1970s and 1980s the hospital received support from its biggest campaigner jimmy savile who gave it a high profile on his television appearances and raised an immense amount of money for the hospital he was knighted for the amount of time he donated the hospital was also visited during princess of wales who opened the new international spinal injuries centre when it was refurbished today the hospital is still growing with a new maternity unit opened in 2009 and plans to refurbish the accident and emergency unit and further extend the hospital new wings have been built in recent years these have been funded by the private finance initiative pfi the pfi is a scheme where the government contract a private company to design build finance and manage a hospital school prison or other public service the company that does this is usually given a 30 year contract the company that is contracted at stoke mandeville hospital is the multinational sodexho sodexho is

received alarming reports from various sources bucks healthcare nhs trust responded by saying it was somewhat irresponsible of buds to potentially worry patients by hinting at patient safety issues at the hospital the charity however defended its action and said buds wanted to give staff patients and visitors at stoke mandeville hospital a wholly anonymous way to report any concerns they might have

massive protest known as million voices against corruption president chen must go in an effort to force the embattled president chen shui bian to resign he led an around the clock sit in in taipei

contact with the world outside prison this shih focused on philosophy history international law linguistics and japanese he also developed a strong and resolute personality in prison in the 1970s taiwan government suffered several blows to its international status first its seat at the united nations was taken over by the people s republic of china then the united states established official ties with beijing severing those with taipei a rebellion in the taiyuan prison where many of the inmates were political prisoners was planned access to the taitung radio station and a publicly broadcast a declaration of taiwan s independence from china was one of their goals many all pro independence prisoners took part in the plot on february 8 1970 five prisoners murdered a guard and tried to take his gun ultimately the five inmates broke from prison only to be caught promptly the breakout plot was foiled the kuomintang believed shih was one of the masterminds of the uprising

internal opposition voice was considered more taboo it was similar to today s communist chinese government policy to oppose speaking out the two obscure political parties in taiwan which had no voice after chiang ching kuo narrowly missed the assassination from the independence in new york the nationalists were sensitive to the threats shih ming te created a party without a name amidst the absence of freedom of association in taiwan at that time on non kuomintang candidates on may 1979 this group of non kuomintang activists established the meilitao magazine shih was named general manager on december 10 1979 this tangwai group commemorates human rights day in kaohsiung the rally operated without prior approval with specific stipulation that no torches and weapons were allowed it was

his defense taiwan should be independent in fact it already is it has been for 30 years and currently it is known to the political monopoly by the kuomintang the press control in taiwan and the

globalization direct maritime links with chinese ports was also part of the proposal shih perceived that the political divide was so severe that he decided to announce his withdrawal three days before the election on september 2003 shih ming te is visiting scholar at george mason university for a one year period during his tenure shih researched what he called the one china european union model as a means of ending the impasse between the two sides of the taiwan strait and reiterates his proposal for a constitutional amendment in favor of a parliamentary system in an attempt to put an end to the political polarization into the two camps blue or kuomintang based and green or democratic progressive party centered which was deteriorating into ethnic rivalry between chinese refugees coming to rule taiwan in 1949 and those who were there before that time political science at national taiwan university opens the shih ming te lecture series ethnic harmony political reconciliation and cross

shui bian steps down if the donations came in on august 22 2006 in seven working days a sum equivalent of that from over 1 million people had been received the actual number of donators can not be computed because there was no restriction on the maximum amount of money one could transfer to the designated account the designated account was quickly closed and the preparations for the marathon protest started on september 1 2006 the anti corruption campaign organizers start training for the sit ins emergency procedures in case of police intervention on september 9 2006 the sit in begins on a rainy day according to the chinapost over 3 hundred thousand people gathered that building in taipei under the pouring rain the taipei police department claims there were only 1 hundred thousand protestors according to the organizers request most of them were wearing red shirts no controversial flags or political icons should be displayed not even the republic of china flag perceived as a pro kuomintang device some protestors still brought along a small republic of china flag or campaign items with them on september 15 2006 a democratic progressive party taipei city counselor had booked

opinion of shih on taiwan daily october 15 his struggle for taiwan s democracy he reveals himself as a visionary he made several pioneering proposals ahead of his time 20 years ago shih already said the four evils of taiwan s path towards democracy were the political monopoly by the kuomintang the press control in taiwan the martial law and the ten thousand year legislative session risking death penalty shih advocated for a republic of china taiwanese independence model and added that taiwan is already an independent country it has been so for over 30 years for his opinions shih was considered seditious and the media organizations academia everyone attacked him and humiliated him only for the democratic progressive party to adopt and implement his ideas they even led the way to lee teng hui s silent revolution political compromises when the kuomintang s 50 years in power ended the chen shui bian administration accepted some of his teachings arrests and repression are no longer the defensive measures of the regime when facing harsh criticism but the abuse humiliate and swear at others is still common practice ddp party has vowed to improve its image with more diplomatic means has yet remain to be seen in the aftermath of shih s red shirt movement he became a darling of prc controlled media including cctvphoenix tv and people s daily shih s efforts in discrediting the dpp are widely praised and reported by various media outlets controlled or owned by the chinese government on november 20 2006 ifeng com web portal of pro ccp television channel phoenix tv reported shih planned a trip to thailand to discuss his red shirt philosophy in the same article shih also rebutted claims by representative of the american institute in taiwan that the red shirts instigated violence and caused social upheaval on january 16 2010 on april 19 2010 www chinataiwan org a chinese government sponsored site reported shih claimed numerous prominent ddp leaders including shui bian chen and chang ting hsieh were undercover agents for the kuomintang against political dissidents during the 1980s according accusations have caused a general panic in the ddp a former supporter and pastor of the presbyterian church wang jie nan wrote an opinion piece highlighting his disappointment with shih starting from shih s red shirt movement and his subsequent efforts to undermine the dpp with outlandish accusations on april 17 2011 shih courted controversy when he asked tsai ing wen to publicly disclose her sexual orientation before she participated in her presidential bid despite his own support for lgbt rights in taiwan shih was roundly criticized by major women s groups including the awakening foundation the taiwan women s link and the taiwan gender

birthplace bradford west yorkshire england deathplace edinburgh scotland sir edward victor appleton gbe kcb frs 6 september 1892 21 april 1965 was an english physicist he won the nobel prize in physics in 1947 for his seminal work proving the existence of the ionosphere during experiments carried out in 1924 biography appleton was born in bradford west yorkshire and educated at hanson grammar school at the age of 18 he won a scholarship to st john s college cambridge he graduated with a first class degree in natural sciences during the first world war he joined the west riding regiment and later transferred to the royal engineers after returning from active service in world war i appleton became assistant demonstrator in experimental physics at the cavendish laboratory in 1920 he was professor of physics at king s college london 192436 and professor of natural philosophy at the university of cambridge 193639 from 1939 to 1949 he was secretary of the he received the 1947 nobel prize in physics for his contributions to the knowledge of the ionosphere which led to the development of radar from 1949 until his death in 1965 he was principal and vice chancellor of the university of edinburgh in 1956 the bbc invited him to deliver the annual reith lectures across a series of six radio broadcasts titled science and the nation appleton explored the many facets of scientific activity in britain at the time works appleton had observed that the strength of the radio signal from a transmitter on a frequency such as the medium wave band and over a path of a hundred miles or so was constant during the day but that it varied during the night this led him to believe that it was possible that two radio signals were being received one was travelling along the ground and another was reflected by a layer in the upper atmosphere the fading or variation in strength of the overall radio signal received resulted from the a reflecting atmospheric layer was not in itself a completely new idea balfour stewart had suggested the idea in the late nineteenth century to explain rhythmic changes in the earths magnetic field more recently in 1902 oliver heaviside and a e kennelly had suggested such a hypothesis may explain the success marconi had in transmitting his signals across the atlantic calculations had shown that natural bending of the radio waves was not sufficient to stop them from simply shooting off into empty space before they reached the receiver appleton thought the best place to look for evidence of the ionosphere was in the variations he believed it was causing around sunset in radio signal receptions it was sensible to suggest these variations were due to the interference of two waves but an extra step to show that the second wave causing the interference the first being the ground wave was coming down from the ionosphere the experiment he designed had two methods to show ionospheric influence and both allowed the height of the lower boundary of reflection thus the lower the first method was called frequency modulation and the second was to calculate the angle of arrival of the reflected signal at the receiving aerial the frequency modulation method exploits the fact that there is a path difference between the ground wave and the reflected wave meaning they travel different distances from sender to receiver let the distance ac travelled by the ground wave be h and the distance abc travelled by the reflected wave h the path difference is math h h d math the wavelength of the transmitted signal is the number of wavelengths difference between the paths h and h is math frach h lambda fracdlambda n math if n is an integer number then constructive interference will occur this means a maximum signal will be achieved at the receiving end if n is an odd integer number of half wavelengths then destructive interference will occur and a minimum signal will be received let us assume we are receiving a maximum signal for a given wavelength if we start to change this is the process called number and destructive interference will start to occur meaning the signal will start to fade now we keep changing until a maximum signal is once again received the means that for our new value our new value n is an also an integer number if we have lengthened then we know that n is one less than n thus math n n fracdlambda fracdlambda 1 math rearranging for d gives math d h h 29 105634 toolong math as we know and we can calculate d using the approximation that abc is an isosceles triangle we can use our value of d to calculate the height of the reflecting layer this method is a slightly simplified version of the method used by appleton and his colleagues to work out a first value for the height of the ionosphere in 1924 in their experiment they used the bbc broadcasting station in bournemouth to vary the wavelengths of its emissions after the evening programmes had finished they installed a receiving station in oxford to monitor the interference effects the receiving station emitter at the right distance of about 100 km from cambridge in those days this frequency modulation method revealed that the point from which waves were being reflected was approximately 90 km however it did not establish that the waves were reflected from above indeed they may have been coming from hills somewhere between oxford and bournemouth the second method which involved finding the angle of incidence of the reflected waves at the receiver showed for sure that they were coming from above triangulations from this angle gave results for the height of reflection compatible with the frequency modulation method we will not go into this method in detail because it involves fairly complex calculations using maxwells electromagnetic theory far from being conclusive the success of the oxford bournemouth experiment revealed a vast new field of study to be explored it showed that there was indeed a reflecting layer high above the earth but it also posed many new questions what was the constitution of this layer how did it reflect the waves was it the same so dramatically between day and night did it change throughout the year appleton would spend the rest of his life answering these questions he developed a magneto ionic theory based on the previous work of lorentz and maxwell to model the workings of this part of the atmosphere using this theory and further experiments he showed that the so called kennelly heaviside layer was heavily ionised and thus conducting this led to the term ionosphere he showed free electrons to be the ionising agents he discovered that the layer could be penetrated by waves above a certain frequency and that this critical frequency could be used to calculate the electron density in the layer however these penetrating waves would also be reflected back but from a much higher layer this showed the ionosphere had a much more complex structure than first anticipated the lower level was labelled e layer reflected longer wavelengths and was found to be at approximately 125 km the high level which had much higher electron density was labelled f layer and could reflect much situated 300 400 km above the earths surface it is this which is often referred to as the appleton layer as is responsible for enabling most long range short wave telecommunication the magneto ionic theory also allowed appleton to explain the origin of the mysterious fadings heard on the radio around sunset during the day the light from the sun causes the molecules in the air to become ionised even at fairly low altitudes at these low altitudes the density of the air is great and thus the electron density of ionised air is very large due to this heavy ionisation there is strong absorption of electromagnetic waves caused by electron friction thus in transmissions over any distance there will be no reflections as any waves apart from the one at ground level will be absorbed rather than reflected however when the sun sets the molecules slowly start to recombine with their electrons and the free electron density levels drop this means absorption rates diminish and waves can be reflected with sufficient strengths to be noticed leading interference patterns to occur though there must not simply be the presence of a reflected wave but a change in the reflected wave otherwise the interference is constant and fadings would not be heard the received signal would simply be louder or softer than during the day this suggests the height at which reflection happens must slowly change as the sun sets appleton found in fact that it increased as the sun set and then decreased as the sun rose until the reflected wave was too weak to record this variation is compatible with the theory that ionisation is due to the suns influence at sunset the intensity of the suns radiation will be much less at the surface of the earth than it is high up in the atmosphere this means ionic recombination will progress slowly from lower altitudes to higher ones and therefore the height at which waves are reflected slowly increases as the sun sets the basic idea behind appletons work is so simple that it is hard to understand at first how he devoted almost all of the last couple of paragraphs some of the complexities of the subject have been introduced like many other fields it is one that grows in intricacy the more it is studied by the end of his life ionospheric observatories had been set up all over the world to provide a global map of the reflecting layers links were found to the 11 year sunspot cycle and the aurora borealis the magnetic storms that occur in high latitudes this became particularly relevant during the second world war when the storms would lead to radio blackouts thanks to appletons research the periods when these would occur could be predicted and communication could be switched to wavelengths that would be least affected radar another crucial wartime innovation was one that came about thanks to appletons work on a very general level his research consisted in determining the distance of reflecting objects from radio signal transmitters this is exactly the idea of radar and the flashing dots that appear on the screen a cathode ray tube scanned by by appleton as a new method called the pulse method to make ionospheric measurements it was later adapted by robert watson watt to detect aeroplanes nowadays ionospheric data is important when communications with satellites are considered the correct frequencies for these signals must be selected so that they actually reach the satellites without being reflected or deviated before in 1974 the radio and space research station was renamed the appleton laboratory in honour of the man who had done so much to establish the uk as a leading force in ionospheric research and had been involved with the station first as a researcher and then as secretary of its parent body the department of scientific and industrial research honours and awards appleton was awarded the following fellow of the royal society 1927 foreign honorary member of

applied area of specialization usually music performance composition or conducting with graduate level academic study in subjects such as music history music theory or music pedagogy the d m a degree usually takes about three to four years of full time study to complete in addition to the masters and bachelors degrees preparing students to be professional performers conductors and composers as a terminal degree the d m a qualifies its recipient to work in university college and conservatory teaching research positions types the d m a is widely available in the concentrations of performance sometimes with a specialization in pedagogy and or literature composition and conducting some universities awarding doctoral degrees in these areas use the title doctor of music d m or d mus or doctor of arts d a or doctor in musical studies ph d instead of d m a national association of schools of music who approved the first d m a programs in 1952 northwestern university the university of michigan and the eastman school of music became the first to offer the d m a boston university offered its first d m a program in 1955 in 2005 boston university also expanded into online music education by launching the first online doctoral degree in music a d m a program along with a master of music program in music education several u s institutions offer the d m a degree today the ph d is generally considered to be more research oriented while other doctorates may place more emphasis on practical applications and or include a performance component such distinctions among degree types not always so clear cut however for instance most programs include traditional research training and culminate in a written dissertation regardless of degree designation the music education degree can be a d m a or ph d also music education ph d programs may include performance oriented tracks in composition one may study for either the d m a or the ph d standard doctorate in music theory musicology music therapy and ethnomusicology a related program is the doctor of sacred music d s m which tends to be awarded by seminaries or university music schools that focus on church music choral conducting and organ performance components d m a students typically complete applied studies such as lessons or mentoring with a professor and take courses within their area of specialization in many d m a programs all of the different d m a streams e g performance composition conducting take a common core of music theory and music history courses many d m a programs require students to pass a comprehensive exam on their area of specialization and on subjects such as music history and music theory the last stage of the d m a degree is usually the completion of a thesis dissertation or research project and the performance of recitals usually including at least one lecture recital some programs additionally require a sub specialization in a cognate area within music such as music history or performance practice which contributes student doing a d m a in baroque violin might do a sub specialization in baroque music history or baroque era dance some institutions permit d m a students to do a sub specialization in a field outside music that contributes to their professional and academic goals for example a student completing a d m a in piano pedagogy may be able to do a sub specialization in the university s department of psychology e g on the psychology of learning and memory a student completing a d m a in electronic composition may be permitted to do a sub specialization in the department of computer engineering e g in computer programming while teaching experience is not an official part of most d m a programs most d m a candidates will have the opportunity to work as a teaching assistant or lecturer for undergraduate students during their degree either as a requirement of their 25 107960 toolong package or as a part time employee of the university d m a students can teach in an area related to their d m a program or if they have multiple skill areas e g a person with an m mus in piano they may teach in another area admission requirements to be admitted to a d m a degree program most institutions require a master s degree such as a m mus degree or an m a degree in music or an equivalent course of study usually with a grade average of b or higher d m a programs in performance usually require applicants to prepare solo literature that is the equivalent of a graduate recitali e several advanced pieces from a wide range of stylesin addition to orchestral excerpts admission to doctoral programs in conducting often require a video recording of live rehearsals and performances as a pre screening element composition programs usually require the submission of a portfolio of compositions including scores and recordings of live performances programs in music education generally require two or more years of public school or similar teaching experience and may further require an example of scholarly writing newly admitted d m a students are usually required to pass a series of diagnostic tests in music history theory and sometimes ear training to confirm thorough command of essential musical principles is not permitted until the tests are passed and or remedial coursework in deficient area s is completed often the knowledge of a second language one of languages of major influence in music history such as german french italian spanish or russian is required to complete the degree the graduate admissions branch of many us universities require applicants to complete the graduate record examination gre a standardized test of abstract thinking skills in the areas of math vocabulary and analytical writing while the outcome of the gre test may affect an applicant s eligibility for some university wide scholarships it does not always affect admission to the music program of the university brief history after world war ii there had been a sharp rise in music education at the university level as was the case with many occupations the music world was experiencing an unprecedented number of discharged musicians from the u s armed forces the g i bill was an impetus for many opting for college causing a spike and a spike in enrollment in music education universities had an opportunity to employ formidable musicians but many including those of international rank lacked a terminal academic degree that would put them on equal footing with professors post world war ii also a period of rise the quality of comprehensive music education at universities the nation s renowned conservatories such a juilliard and curtis at the time saw no need for the degree yet many alumni of those institutions and many top musicians with no degree were the very people being sought by universities offering degrees in music and music education in 1952 after six years of deliberation the national association of schools of music nasm approved thirty two schools for graduate degrees for graduate work in one or more of the fields into which graduate music study has been divided the nasm was and still is the only accrediting agency for music schools recognized by the american council on education in 1952 143 music schools had already established standards for meeting criteria was 1953 eastman school of music the dma degree was approved by the state of new york board of regents in 1953 boston university university of southern california the dean of the university of rochester eastman school of music howard harold hanson 18961981 who had been awarded an honorary doctorate in 1925 was one of several high profile advocates of creating a performance oriented doctors degree in 1953 he published a proposal for a doctor of musical arts degree which was roundly criticized by paul henry long phd professor of musicology at columbia university early doctor of musical arts conferred 1954 mathias matt higgins doran dma born 1921 university of southern california 1955 will gay bottje dma born 1925 eastman school of music some sources attribute bottje as having been the first in the nation to earn the degree august 1955

speaker of the house of representatives is the individual who chairs the country s legislative body the new zealand house of representatives often also referred to as parliament the speaker fulfils a number of important functions in relation to the operation of the house which is based upon the british westminster parliamentary system the current speaker is david carter role in the debating chamber the speaker s most visible role is that of presiding over the house when in session this involves overseeing the order in which business is conducted and determining who should speak at what time the speaker is also responsible for granting or declining requests for certain events such as a snap debate on a particular issue an important part of the speaker s role is ruling on matters of procedure known as points of order based on standing orders and previously made speakers rulings this has a large bearing on the smooth running of each parliamentary session speaker to ensure reasonable behaviour by mps including the ability to remove disruptive mps from the debating chamber the speaker presides over the business of parliament from the elevated speaker s chair behind the table in the debating chamber outside the debating chamber the speaker is also responsible for directing and overseeing the administration and security of the buildings and grounds of parliament including the beehive parliament house bowen house and the parliamentary library building and the general provision of services to members in doing so the speaker consults and receives advice from the parliamentary service commission which comprises mps from across the house the speaker also presides over some select committees including the standing orders committee the business committee and the officers of parliament committee the speaker also has some other statutory responsibilities for example under the electoral act 1993 the speaker is third in the new zealand order of precedence behind the governor general and the prime minister neutrality the speaker is expected to conduct even though the speaker is generally a member of the governing party only three people have held the office despite not being from the governing party in 1923 charles statham an independent but formerly a member of the reform party was backed by reform so as not to endanger the party s slim majority and later retained his position under the liberal party in 1993 peter tapsell a member of the labour party was backed by the national party for the same reason bill barnard who had been elected speaker in 1936 resigned from the labour party in 1940 but retained his position historically a speaker lost the right to cast a vote except when both sides were equally balanced the speaker s lack of a vote created problems for a governing party when the party s majority was small the loss of the speaker s vote could be problematic since 1996 however the speaker votes in the same way that any other mp does and in the election of the speaker the speaker is always a member of parliament and is elected by the house at the beginning of a parliamentary term if the office of speaker becomes vacant during a parliamentary term the house must elect a new speaker when it next sits the election of a speaker is presided over by the clerk of the house it is not unusual for an election to be contested if there are two candidates members vote in the lobbies for their preferred candidate in the case of three or more candidates a roll call vote is conducted and the candidate with the fewest votes eliminated with the process continuing or reverting to a two way run off until one candidate has a majority members may vote only if they are present in person no proxy votes are permitted after being elected by the house the speaker elect is confirmed in office by the governor general at the start of a term of parliament the newly confirmed speaker follows the tradition of claiming the privileges the current speaker is david carter a member of the national party which is the largest party in parliament and governs as a minority since the creation of parliament 29 people have held the office of

discontinued the first deputy speaker was appointed on 10 november 1992 gameline was a dialup game distribution service for the atari 2600 developed and operated by control video corporation cvc subscribers could install the proprietary modem and storage cartridge in their home game console accessing the gameline service to download games over a telephone line gameline is notable for its exclusive selection of games and for its pioneering business model which eventually gave rise to america online in the early 1980s a cable pioneer named william von meister was looking for a way to use his innovative modem transmission technology which was previously acquired in ill fated attempts of sending music to cable companies legal issues caused cable providers to step away from the service leaving von meister with a delivery tool and no content he then converted his variable speed adaptive modem technology to download games from central servers to individual households this allowed users to dial a system and for a fee download games to their gameline modules the game would typically work for 5 10 plays after which the user another download the master module physically resembles an oversized silver atari cartridge it has a phone jack on the side that was used to link the master module with the cvc computers the module is able to transmit with pulse or tone dialing allowing the unit to be versatile in the field the games available on the gameline service were all from third party gamemakers the largest of which was imagic whose catalog is now controlled by activision cvc tried but failed to obtain licensing agreements from the largest game makers such as atari activision coleco mattel and parker brothers membership benefits when a user registered with the service they were given a pin this pin was used to log into the central cvc computer and download the requested games one of the benefits of registering was that users were given free games on

kent william pitt amherst 1st earl amherst gch pc 14 january 1773 13 march 1857 was a british diplomat and colonial administrator he was governor general of india between 1823 and 1828 background and education born at bath somerset amherst was the son of william amherst and elizabeth daughter of thomas paterson he was the grand nephew of jeffrey amherst 1st baron amherst and succeeded to his title in 1797 according to a special remainder in the letters patent he was educated at westminster school and christ church oxford ambassador extraordinary to china in 1816 he was sent as ambassador extraordinary to the court of china s qing dynasty with a view of establishing more satisfactory commercial relations between that country and the united kingdom on arriving at pei ho baihe today s haihe he was given to understand that he could only be admitted the kowtow a ceremony which great britain considered degrading a view that was not shared by either the netherlands nor russia which also traded with china and which was indeed a homage exacted by a chinese sovereign from his tributaries to this amherst following the advice of sir george thomas staunton who accompanied him as second commissioner refused to consent as macartney had done in 1793 unless the admission was made that his sovereign was entitled to the same show of reverence from a mandarin of his rank in consequence of this he was not allowed to enter peking beijing and the object of his mission was frustrated his ship the alceste after a cruise along the coast of korea and to the ryukyu islands on proceeding homewards was totally wrecked on a submerged rock in gaspar strait amherst and part of his shipwrecked companions escaped in the ship s boats to batavia whence relief was sent to the rest the at st helena and as a consequence he had several interviews with the emperor napoleon see ellis s proceedings of the late embassy to china 1817 mcleod s narrative of a voyage in h m s alceste 1817 governor general of india amherst was governor general of india from august 1823 to february 1828 the principal event of his government was the first burmese war of 1824 resulting in the cession of arakan and tenasserim to the british empire his appointment came on the heels of the removal of governor general lord hastings in 1823 hastings clashed with london over the issue of lowering the field pay of officers in the bengal army a measure that he was able to avoid through successive wars against nepal and the marathas however his refusal in the early 1820s during peacetime to lower field pay resulted in the appointment of amherst who was expected to carry out the demands from london however amherst was an inexperienced governor who was at influenced heavily by senior military officers in bengal such as sir edward paget not willing to lose face in a time of burmese territorial aggression when a territorial dispute that he inherited from john adam acting governor general prior to his arrival involving the anglo burmese border on the naaf river spilled over into violence on 24 september 1823 he ordered the troops in the war was to take two years with 15 000 killed on the british side and cost 13 million pounds contributing to an economic crisis in india it was only due to the efforts of powerful friends such as george canning and the duke of wellington that he was not recalled in disgrace at the end of the war the war significantly changed amherst s stance on burma now adamantly refusing to annex lower burma but did not repair his reputation entirely and he was replaced in 1828 he was created earl amherst of arracan in the east indies and viscount holmesdale in the county of kent in 1826 on death in march 1857 family lord amherst s first wife was 1762 1838

rest of introduces new gameplay elements such as mega man s canine sidekick rush and the ability to slide along the ground unlike with the first two installments of the series artist and designer keiji inafune has considered the creation of mega man 3 to be very stressful due to time constraints and his own increased responsibilities during its development following the success of mega man 2 released two years earlier mega man 3 has sold over one million copies and has been positively received in critical reviews its presentation and gameplay has been especially praised although many sources found the game to be too difficult like other titles in the series mega man 3 has been re released several times on other gaming platforms on mobile phones and as part of various mega man franchise compilations plot mega man 3 takes place during an unspecified year during the 21st century 200x the mad scientist dashed claims to have reformed and begins work with dr light on a project

consciousness in dr light s lab his creator informs him that he must have been rescued by proto man mega man s brother gameplay mega man 3 retains the platforming and action game elements established by the two mega man games released before it the player controls the protagonist mega man as he traverses eight selectable stages the player s primary blaster weapon is used to fend off the game s numerous enemies several power ups can be picked up in each stage including life energy special weapon ammunition extra lives and e tanks which are stored and can be selected to completely refill the player s life energy at the end of every stage the player must defeat a robot master boss magnet man hard man top man shadow man spark man snake man gemini man or and stage related to the weapon s power after defeating a boss their signature weapon is added to mega man s arsenal the robot masters are weak to the weapons of certain other robot masters allowing the player to ease the boss battles by clearing some stages before others mega man 3 is the first mega man game to feature the slide maneuver which lets the player slip under enemy attacks and low level barriers after completing certain stages mega man can access new abilities in his robot dog companion rush rush s transformations include the rush coil for jumping higher the rush jet for flying around the screen and the rush marine for traveling underwater throughout the various stages the player encounters proto man as break man a mini boss who once defeated will open passageways for the player to advance mega man 3 also expands upon the two preceding games by having additional stages set between the initial eight robot masters a password system can be used to return to the game with most of the stages completed development development on mega man 3 began at capcom over a year after the release of mega man 2 the lead supervisor for the first two games quit his job at the company during that gap of time artist keiji inafune credited as inafking considered mega man 3 as one of his least favorite entries in the series due to what went into the game and what was behind the release of the game he had preset notions about successful development because of the team s good experience with mega man 2 and found that his new superior did n t really understand mega man the way his predecessor did during the game s production the developers lost the main planner so inafune had to take over that job for its completion inafune recalled the final two months of development as particularly and dividing up tasks among the team members who were not meeting deadlines the team was forced to put mega man 3 on the market before they thought it was ready inafune concluded i knew that if we had more time to polish it we could do a lot of things better make it a better game but the company said that we needed to release it the whole environment behind what went into the production of the game is what i least favored numbers one and two i really wanted to make the games i was so excited about them number three it just turned very different mega man 3 brought new characters and gameplay mechanics to the franchise though inafune considers the gameplay to have lost some of its simplicity he felt mega man s slide ability was successfully implemented to enhance the player s control while battling enemies mega man s sidekick dog rush was designed by combining the functionality of three support tools from the player s navigation of stages in addition to the marine and coil modes rush was originally intended to have a drill mode that would allow mega man to tunnel underground another new character proto man was introduced in a way that the player would be unable to tell if he was an ally or an enemy to mega man his design was influenced by anime and he was given both a scarf and shield to make him appear tougher than mega man the design team wanted proto man to sport uncovered hair but they instead opted for an open faced helmet illustration for both the television commercials and instruction manual proto man s original japanese name blues was changed by capcom s north american division despite inafune s protests capcom did this not only to be consistent with rockman s english name but because they thought that the name blues made no sense inafune attempted to defend it due to the name s musical connotation to character names in the series though rush and proto ideas from fans for the creation of the game s robot masters as they had done with mega man 2 the team received around 50 000 design submissions for mega man 3 only eight of which were used in the game the soundtrack for mega man 3 was created by capcom composer yasuaki fujita also known as bun bun his wife harumi credited in special thanks as mrs tarumi was the initial composer of the game but she only completed two songs before giving birth and dropping off the project fujita co composed the score for the follow up mega man 4 with minae fujii in 1991 reception mega man 3 has enjoyed a positive reception from print and online sources lucas m thomas of ign christian nutt and justin

the game as a major improvement over the original mega man and that it even surpasses the critically acclaimed mega man 2 in quality moriarty justified this claim with the third installment s attempt at better storytelling its longer length than any other classic mega man game and its inclusion of all eight mega man 2 robot masters in addition to its own some critics have judged mega man 3 to be excessively difficult gamepro contributor mckinley noble comically stated that actions such as pulling teeth lifting a car over your head or mega man 3 whitehead noted leaps must be precise enemies must be dispatched rapidly and accurately and there s a constant state of delicious near panic as you wait to see what vicious demands the next room will place on your platforming skills the lessers

for ransom sometimes called artnapping stolen art is sometimes used by criminals as collateral to secure loans only a small percentage of stolen art is recoveredestimates range from 5 to 10 this means that little is known about the scope and characteristics of art theft individual theft many thieves are motivated by the fact that valuable art pieces are worth millions of dollars and weigh only a few kilograms at most transport for items such as paintings is also trivial assuming the thief is willing to inflict some damage to the painting by cutting it off the frame and rolling it up into a tube carrier also while most high profile museums have extremely tight security many places with multimillion art collections works have disproportionately poor security measures that makes them susceptible to thefts that are slightly more complicated than a typical smash and grab but offer a huge potential payoff for those with substantial collections such as the marquess of cholmondeley at houghton negotiable jean baptiste oudry s white duck was stolen from the cholmondeley collection at houghton hall in 1990 the canvas is still missing prevention in museums museums can take numerous measures to prevent the theft of artworks include having enough docents or guards to watch displayed items avoiding situations where security camera sightlines are blocked and fastening paintings to walls with hanging wires that are not too thin and with locks art theft education the smithsonian institution sponsors the national conference on cultural property protection held annually in

interpol the fbi art crime team london s metropolitan police new york police department s special frauds squad and a number of other law enforcement agencies worldwide maintain squads dedicated to investigating thefts of this nature and recovering stolen works of art according to robert king wittman a former fbi agent who led the art crime team until his retirement in 2008 the unit is very small compared with similar law enforcement units in europe and most art thefts investigated by the fbi involve agents at local offices who handle routine property theft art and antiquity crime is tolerated in part in 2010 state theft wartime looting and misappropriation by museums from 1933 through the end of world war ii the nazi regime maintained a policy of looting art for sale or for removal to museums in the third reich hermann gring head of the luftwaffe personally took charge of hundreds of valuable pieces generally stolen from jews and other victims of the holocaust in early 2011 about 1 500 art masterpieces assumed to have been stolen by the nazis during and before world war ii were confiscated from a private home in munich germany the confiscation was not made public until november 2013 with an estimated value of 1 billion their discovery is considered astounding and includes works by pablo picasso henri matisse marc chagall paul klee max beckmann and emil nolde all of which were considered lost the looted mostly modernist art was banned by the nazis when they came to power on the grounds that it was un german or jewish bolshevist in nature by the nazis may be able to claim ownership of many of the works members of the families of the original owners of these artworks have in many cases persisted in claiming title to their pre war property the 1964 film the train starring burt lancaster is based on the true story of works of art which had been placed in storage for protection in france during the war but was looted by the germans from french museums and private art collections to be shipped by train back to germany another film the monuments men 2014 co produced co written and directed by george clooney is based on a similar true life story in this film u s soldiers are tasked with saving over a million pieces of art and other culturally important items throughout europe before their destruction by nazi plunder in 2006 after a protracted court battle in the united states and austria see republic of austria v altmann five paintings by austrian niece of pre war owner ferdinand bloch bauer two of the paintings were portraits of altmann s aunt adele the more famous of the two the gold portrait of adele bloch bauer i was sold in 2006 by altmann and her co heirs to philanthropist ronald lauder for 135 million at the time of the sale it was the highest known price ever paid for a painting the remaining four restituted paintings were later sold at christie s new york for over 190 million because antiquities are often regarded by the country of origin as national treasures there are numerous cases where artworks often displayed in the acquiring country for decades have become the subject of highly charged and political controversy one prominent example is the case of the elgin marbles which were moved from greece to the british museum in 1816 by thomas bruce 7th earl of elgin many different greek governments have maintained that removal was tantamount to theft similar controversies have arisen over etruscan aztec and italian artworks the removal of artifacts is a pernicious form of cultural imperialism yale university s peabody museum of natural history is engaged as of november 2006 in talks with the government of peru about possible repatriation of artifacts taken during the excavation of machu picchu by yale s hiram bingham in 2006 new york s metropolitan museum reached an agreement with italy to return many disputed pieces the getty museum in los angeles is also involved in a series of cases of this nature the artwork in question is of greek and ancient italian origin the museum agreed on november 20 2006 to return 26 contested pieces to italy one of the getty s signature pieces a statue of the goddess

elections in 2002 the party won in an alliance with the free bolivia movement 26 9 of the popular vote and 36 out of 130 seats in the chamber of deputies and 11 out of 27 seats in the senate its candidate at the presidential elections gonzalo snchez de lozada won 22 5 of the popular vote and was subsequently confirmed by parliament as president after the 2002 elections it ruled in a coalition with the revolutionary left movement with snchez as president he had been president from 1993 to 1997 snchez was overthrown in a 2003 popular uprising and the party s future is uncertain especially as its last government has been tarnished by serious accusations of corruption mismanagement and even homicidal repression the revolutionary nationalist hernn siles zuazo it eventually attracted some of the brightest members of the bolivian intelligentsia among the party s most prominent supporters one can name in addition to paz and siles historical figures such as humberto guzmn fricke juan lechn carlos montenegro walter guevara arze javier del granado augusto cspedes lydia gueiler guillermo bedregal and gonzalo snchez de lozada a number of whom became presidents of bolivia at the time it was a leftist reformist party along the lines of similar latin american parties such as the dominican revolutionary party democratic action of venezuela and the peruvian aprista party the mnr first came to power in 1943 in support of the reformist military regime of gualberto villarroel it was at the time tainted however by the alleged pro fascist sympathies of various of its leaders and the united states then at war with the axis insisted that its members be removed from the villarroel government in exchange for official recognition the revolutionary nationalist movement led a its first incarnation until being overthrown by a 1964 military coup siles president from 1956 to 1960 and paz estenssoro president from 195256 and 196064 were the top leaders of that revolutionary period establishing the universal vote nationalizing the tin mines and instituting an extensive program of land distribution agrarian reform during this time many of the old elitist parties that had previously dominated bolivian politics either disappeared or faded into irrelevance this left the mnr in the center of the bolivian political spectrum siles and paz however split in the 1960s over paz s ambitions and personal control of the party filled with strong personalities the party had in fact begun to fragment along political and personal lines since the late 1950s with wlter guevara being the first to leave and the popular juan lechn being expelled in 1964 siles went on to form the revolutionary nationalist leftwing movement mnri and lechn the revolutionary party of the nationalist left prin the years with the main body of the mnr firmly in paz estenssoro s s control the old leader made what can be seen as a major mistake in 1971 when he supported the coming to power of dictator hugo banzer surez it was a move that was to cost his party dearly at the polls in subsequent years while paz seemed to be moving steadily to the right siles zuazo went on to lead the udp union democratica popular in alliance with the new and popular movimiento de izquierda revolucionaria mir indeed siles was the post mnr politician who was best able to capitalize on the remaining legitimacy and respect that accrued to the mnr as a result of the 1952 revolution paz estenssoro led the mnr proper in the 1978 1979 and 1980 elections finishing third second and second respectively he was finally elected president for the 4th time in 1985 and served as bolivia s chief executive from 1985 until 1989 when he retired from politics by this and now advocated neoliberal economic policies under paz important economic reforms designed to curb hyperinflation were instituted the labor unions were repressed and 30 000 miners were fired from state payrolls as a result of the collapse of global tin prices the painful readjustment policies adopted by the elderly paz and his vigorous minister of planning gonzalo sanchez de lozada came to be known as the new economic policy nep and restructured the bulk of the hitherto statist and now neoliberal bolivian economy led by sanchez de lozada the mnr won the 1993 elections and sanchez was confirmed as president by parliament he

presidency to the former dictator banzer at the legislative elections of 30 june 2002 the party together with the free bolivia movement won 26 9 of the popular vote and 36 out of 130 27 in the senate following these elections because no candidate could get a majority the congress chose the president and they chose snchez de lozada in 2003 however he was forcwed to resign and his successor carlos mesa took over as an independent he was never a party member in hopes of promoting national unity in the face of nation wide protests mesa later resigned and presidential elections were moved up to december 2005 the mnr earned 6 5 of the popular vote and won 7 out of 130 seats in the chamber of deputies and 1 out of 27 seats in the senate in the legislative elections its candidate in the presidential elections was michiaki nagatani whose poor performance seems to signal a steep decline in the fortunes of the party the revolutionary nationalist movement is led by guillermo bedregal gutirrez project habakkuk or habbakuk spelling varies see below was a plan by the british in world war ii to construct an aircraft carrier out of pykrete a mixture of wood pulp and ice for use against german u boats in the mid atlantic which were beyond the flight range of land based planes at that time the idea came from geoffrey pyke who worked for combined operations headquarters history initial concept geoffrey pyke was an old friend of j d bernal and had originally been recommended to lord mountbatten chief of combined operations by the cabinet minister leopold amery pyke worked at combined operations headquarters cohq alongside bernal and was regarded as a genius by mountbatten pyke conceived the idea of habbakuk while in the us organising the production of m29 weasels for project plough a scheme to assemble an elite unit for winter operations in norway romania and the italian alps he had been considering the problem of how to protect seaborne landings and atlantic was that steel and aluminium were in short supply and required for other purposes pyke realized that the answer was ice which could be manufactured for only 1 of the energy needed to make an equivalent mass of steel he proposed that an iceberg natural or artificial be levelled to provide a runway and hollowed out to shelter aircraft from new york pyke sent the proposal he had composed on habbakuk via diplomatic bag to cohq with a label forbidding anyone apart from mountbatten from opening the package mountbatten in turn passed pyke s proposal on to churchill who was enthusiastic about it pyke was not the first to suggest a floating mid ocean stopping point for aircraft nor even the first to suggest that such a floating island could be made of ice german scientist dr gerke von waldenburg proposed the idea and carried out some preliminary experiments in lake zurich in 1930 the idea was a recurring one in 1940 an idea for an ice island was circulated round the admiralty but was treated as a a memorandum that gathered ever more caustic comments the document had to be retrieved just before it reached the sea lord s inbox code name and spelling the project s code name seems to have been consistently mis spelled habbakuk in the admiralty and government documents at the time this may in fact have been pyke s own error as at least one early document apparently written by him though unsigned spells it that way however post war publications by people concerned with the project e g perutz and goodeve all restore the proper one b and three k s spelling the name is a biblical reference to the project s ambitious goal be utterly amazed for i am going to do something in your days that you would not believe even if you were told habakkuk 1 5 niv david lampe in his book pyke the unknown genius states that the and was misspelt by his canadian secretary however the word does not actually appear in that text so this is probably inaccurate pykrete in early 1942 pyke and bernal called in max perutz to determine whether an ice floe large enough to withstand atlantic conditions could be built up fast enough he pointed out that natural icebergs have too small a surface above water for an airstrip and are prone to suddenly rolling over the project would have been abandoned except for the invention of pykrete a mixture of water and woodpulp which frozen together was stronger than plain ice was slower melting and of course would not sink it has been suggested that pyke was inspired by inuit sleds reinforced with moss this is probably apocryphal as the material was originally described in a paper by mark and hohenstein in brooklyn ny pykrete could be machined like wood and cast into shapes like metal and when immersed in water formed an insulating shell of wet wood pulp on its surface perutz found a problem ice slowly flows in what is known as plastic flow and his tests showed that a pykrete ship would slowly sag unless it was cooled to 16 c to accomplish this the ship s surface would have to be protected by insulation and it would need a refrigeration plant and a complicated system of ducts experiments on the viability of pykrete and the optimum composition of it were conducted by perutz in a secret location underneath smithfield meat market in the city of london the research took place in a refrigerated meat locker behind a protective screen of frozen animal carcasses scale model the decision was made to build a large scale model at jasper national park in canada to examine insulation and refrigeration techniques and to see how it would stand up to artillery and explosives at lake louise alberta large ice blocks were constructed and a small prototype was constructed at patricia lake alberta measuring only 60 by 30 feet 18 by 9 m weighing in at the work was done by conscientious objectors who did alternative service of various kinds instead of military service they were never told what they were building bernal informed cohq that the canadians were building a 1 000 ton model and that it was expected to take 8 men 14 days to build it the chief of combined operations cco responded that churchill had invited the chiefs of staff committee to arrange for an order to be placed for one complete ship at once with the highest priority with further ships to be ordered immediately if it appeared the scheme was certain of success the canadians were confident about constructing a vessel for 1944 the necessary materials were available to them in the form of 300 000 tons of wood pulp 25 000 tons of fibreboard insulation 35 000 tons of timber and 10 000 tons of steel the cost was estimated at 700 000 meanwhile perutz had determined via his experiments at smithfield market that the optimum structural properties were given by a mixture of 14 wood pulp and 86 water he that if certain tests were not completed in may there would be no chance of delivering a completed ship in 1944 by may the problem of plastic flow had become serious and it was obvious that more steel reinforcement would be needed as well as a more effective insulating skin around the vessel s hull this caused the cost estimate to increase to 2 5 million in addition the canadians had decided that it was impractical to attempt the project this coming season and bernal and pyke were forced to conclude that no habbakuk vessel would be ready in 1944 pyke was excluded from the planning for habbakuk in an effort to secure american participation a decision which bernal supported pyke s earlier disagreements with american personnel on project plough which ultimately caused his removal from that project were the main factor in this decision in the early summer of 1943 naval architects and engineers continued to work on habbakuk with bernal and perutz the requirements for the vessel became more demanding it had to have a largest waves recorded while the admiralty wanted it to be torpedo proof which meant that the hull had to be at least 40ft m thick the fleet air arm decided that heavy bombers should be able to take off from it which meant that the deck had to be 2000ft m long steering also raised problems it was initially projected that the ship be steered by varying the speed of the motors on either side but the royal navy decided that a rudder was essential however the problem of mounting and controlling a rudder over 100ft m high was never solved variants naval architects had produced three alternative versions of pyke s original concept which were discussed at a meeting with the chiefs of staff in august 1943 habbakuk i soon discarded would have been made of wood habbakuk ii was closest to the cohq model and would be a very large slow self propelled vessel made of pykrete with steel reinforcement faster version of habbakuk ii air chief marshal portal asked about potential bomb damage to habbakuk iii and bernal suggested that a certain amount of deck covering might be ripped off but could be repaired by some kind of flexible matting it would be more difficult to deal with bomb holes in the centre portion though the roof over the aircraft hangars would be made proof against 1 000 kg bombs bernal considered that no one could say whether the larger habbakuk ii was a practical proposition until a large scale model could be completed and tested in canada in the spring of 1944 he had no doubts about the suitability of pykrete as a material but said that constructional and navigational difficulties remained to be overcome the final design of habbakuk ii gave the bergship as it was referred to a displacement of 2 2 million tons steam turbogenerators were to supply 33000 hp for 26 electric motors mounted in separate external nacelles normal for an ice craft its armament would have included 40 dual barrelled 4 5 dp dual purpose turrets and numerous light anti aircraft guns and it would have housed an airstrip and up to 150 twin engined bombers or fighters shooting incident according to some accounts at the quebec conference of 1943 lord mountbatten brought a block of pykrete along to demonstrate its potential to the bevy of admirals and generals who had come along with winston churchill and franklin d roosevelt mountbatten entered the project meeting with two blocks and placed them on the ground one was a normal ice block and the other was pykrete he then drew his service pistol and shot at the first block it shattered and splintered next he fired at the pykrete to give an idea of the resistance of that kind of ice to projectiles the bullet ricocheted off the block grazing the trouser leg of admiral ernest king and ended up in the wall sir alan brooke s diaries support this account telling how mountbatten brought two blocks first shooting at the ice with a warning to beware of splinters mountbatten said i shall fire at the block on the right to show you the difference brooke reports the bullet rebounded out of the block and buzzed round our legs like an angry bee the meeting in question was a high level summit with a us delegation in the chteau frontenac in quebec max perutz gives an account of a similar incident in his book i wish i made you angry earlier a demonstration of pykrete was given at combined operations headquarters cohq by a naval officer lieutenant commander douglas grant who was provided by perutz with rods of ice and pykrete packed with dry ice in thermos flasks and large blocks of ice and pykrete grant demonstrated the comparative strength of ice and pykrete by firing bullets into both blocks the ice shattered but the bullet rebounded from the pykrete and hit the chief of the imperial staff sir alan brooke in the shoulder later that year habbakuk began to lose priority mountbatten listed several reasons the great demand for steel permission had been received from portugal to use airfields in the azores which facilitated the hunting of u boats in the atlantic the introduction of long range fuel tanks that allowed british based aircraft extra patrol time over the atlantic increased numbers of escort carriers in addition mountbatten himself had withdrawn from the project the final habbakuk board meeting took place in december 1943 and it was announced that the large habbakuk ii made of pykrete has been found to be impractical because of the enormous production resources required and technical difficulties involved the use of ice had actually been falling out of favour before that with other ideas for floating islands being considered such as welding liberty ships or landing craft together project tentacle it took three hot summers to completely melt the prototype constructed in canada perutz in his account writes that he sojourned in washington d c while u s navy engineers evaluated the finally decided that habakkuk was a false prophet one reason was the enormous amount of steel needed for the refrigeration plant that was to freeze the pykrete was greater than that needed to build the entire carrier of steel but the crucial argument was that the rapidly increasing range of land based aircraft rendered floating islands unnecessary criticism the habakkuk design received criticism notably from sir charles goodeve assistant controller of research and development for the admiralty during world war ii in an article published after the war goodeve pointed out the large amount of wood pulp that would be required enough to affect paper production significantly he also claimed that each ship would require 40 000 tons of cork insulation thousands of miles of steel tubing for brine circulation and four power stations but that for all those resources some of which could be used to manufacture conventional ships of more effective fighting power habakkuk would only be capable of six knots of speed much of his article also contained extensive derisive comments about the properties recreations in the 15 april 2009 episode of mythbusters jamie hyneman and adam savage built a small boat out of a modified formulation of pykrete using newspaper instead of wood pulp they successfully piloted the boat in alaskan waters at a speed of based on this success they determined that it is possible to build a boat out of pykrete they also determined that pykrete lived up to its purported properties of being bulletproof stronger than ice and taking longer to melt than ice however they expressed doubt that an aircraft carrier made of pykrete could have survived long ref cite episode in september 2010 the bbc programme bang goes the theory also attempted to recreate a pykrete boat a hull using 5 000 kg of hemp fibre pykrete was frozen in a cold store then launched in portsmouth harbour for a planned trip across the solent to cowes the hull immediately started to leak due to holes that had been cut in its rear side to birthplace new york city deathplace hollywood california herman jacob mankiewicz pronounced november 7 1897 march 5 1953 was an american screenwriter who with orson welles wrote the screenplay for citizen kane 1941 earlier he was the berlin correspondent for the chicago tribune and the drama critic for the new york times and the new yorker alexander woollcott said that herman mankiewicz was the funniest man in new york both mankiewicz and welles received academy awards for their screenplay he was often asked to fix the screenplays of other writers with much of his work uncredited what distinguished his writing from that of other writers were occasional flashes of the mankiewicz humor and satire that became valued in the films of the 1930s that style of writing included a slick satirical and witty humor which depended almost totally on dialogue to carry the film it was a of that period film author pauline kael credits mankiewicz with having written alone or with others about forty of the films i remember best from the twenties and thirties adding i had n t realized how extensive his career was he was a key linking figure in just the kind of movies my friends and i loved best these were the hardest headed periods of american movies among the screenplays he wrote or worked on besides citizen kane were the wizard of oz man of the world dinner at eight pride of the yankees and the pride of st louis mankiewicz s younger brother was joseph l mankiewicz 19091993 also an oscar winning hollywood director screenwriter and producer personal life herman mankiewicz was born in new york city in 1897 his parents were of german jewish ancestry his father franz mankiewicz hamburg in 1892 he arrived in the u s with his wife a dressmaker named johanna blumenau who was from the german speaking kurland region the family lived first in new york and then moved to wilkes barre pennsylvania where herman s father accepted a teaching position in 1909 herman s brother joseph l mankiewicz who himself would have a career as a successful writer producer and director was born and both boys and a sister spent their childhood there the family moved to new york city in 1913 and herman graduated from columbia university in 1917 he became an alcoholic which hurt his career by the late 1930s his children are screenwriter don mankiewicz politician frank mankiewicz and the late novelist johanna mankiewicz davis writer and screenwriter early career while a reporter in berlin for the chicago tribune he also sent pieces on drama and books to the new york times at one point he was her publicist in preparation for her return tour in america at home again in the u s he took a job as a reporter for the new york world he was known as a gifted prodigious writer and contributed to vanity fair magazine success in hollywood after a month in the movie business mankiewicz signed a year s contract at 400 a week plus bonuses by the end of 1927 he was head of paramount s scenario department and film critic pauline kael who wrote about him and the creation of citizen kane in raising kane her famous 1971 new yorker article wrote that in january 1928 there was a newspaper item reporting that he was in new york lining up a new set of newspaper feature writers and playwrights to bring to hollywood and that most of the newer writers on paramount s staff who contributed the most successful stories of the past year eyman notes that mankiewicz was put in charge of writer recruitment by paramount however as a hard drinking gambler he hired men in his own image ben hecht bartlett cormack edwin justus mayer writers comfortable with the iconoclasm of big city newsrooms who would introduce their sardonic worldliness to movie audiences becoming a major screenwriter kael notes that beginning in 1926 mankiewicz worked on an astounding number of films in 1927 and 1928 he did the titles the printed dialogue and explanations for at least twenty five films that starred clara bow bebe daniels nancy carroll wallace beery and other public favorites by then sound had come in and in 1929 he did the script as well as the dialogue for the dummy and did the scripts for many directors including william wellman and josef von sternberg other screenwriters made large contributions too but probably none larger than mankiewicz s according to kael at the beginning of the sound era he was kael writes he wrote the kind of movies that were disapproved of as fast and immoral his heroes were n t soft eyed and bucolic he brought good humored toughness to the movies and energy and astringency and the public responded because it was eager for modern american subjects according to kael mankiewicz did not work on every kind of picture he did n t do westerns for example and once when a studio attempted to punish him for his customary misbehavior by assigning him to a rin tin tin picture he rebelled by turning in a script that began with the craven dog frightened by a mouse and reached its climax with a house on fire and the dog taking a baby into the flames 246 writer of satire and comedy shortly after his arrival on the west coast he sent a telegram to journalist friend ben hecht in new york millions are to be grabbed out here and your only competition is idiots do n t let this get around he a burst of creative tough and sardonic styles of writing for the fast growing movie industry what distinguished his screenplays were occasional flashes of the mankiewicz humor and satire that proved to be a foreshadowing of a new type of slick satirical typically american film that depended almost totally on dialogue for its success between 1929 and 1935 he was credited with working on a least twenty films many of which he received no credit for between 1930 and 1932 he was either producer or associate producer on four comedies and helped write their screenplays without credit laughter monkey business horse feathers and million dollar legs which many critics considered one of the funniest comedies of the early 1930s in 1933 he co wrote dinner at eight which was based on the george s kaufman edna ferber play and became one of the most popular comedies at that time and remains a classic comedy 1938 he was assigned as the first of ten screenwriters to work on the wizard of oz three days after he started writing he handed in a seventeen page treatment of what was later known as the kansas sequence while baum devoted less than a thousand words in his book to kansas mankiewicz almost balanced the attention on kansas to the section about oz he felt it was necessary to have the audience relate to dorothy in a real world before transporting her to a magic one by the end of the week he had finished writing fifty six pages of the script and included instructions to film the scenes in kansas in black and white his goal according to film historian aljean harmetz was to capture in pictures what baum had captured in wordsthe grey lifelessness of kansas contrasted with the visual richness of oz he was not credited for his work on the film however in looking back on his early films kael writes that mankiewicz had in fact of the films i remember best from the twenties and thirties i had n t realized how extensive his career was and now that i have looked into herman mankiewicz s career it s apparent that he was a key linking figure in just the kind of movies my friends and i loved best these were the hardest headed periods of american movies and the most highly acclaimed directors of that period suggests that the writers in little more than a decade gave american talkies their character banned by the nazis according to the new york times in 1935 while he was a staff writer for mgm the studio was notified by dr paul joseph goebbels then minister of education and propaganda under adolf hitler that films written by mankiewicz could not be shown in nazi germany unless his name was removed from the screen credits citizen kane mankiewicz is best known for his collaboration with orson welles on the screenplay of citizen kane and later became a source of controversy over who wrote what pauline kael attributed kane s screenplay to mankiewicz in an essay for which she did not interview welles and was subsequently strongly disputed by welles and peter bogdanovich much debate has centered around this issue largely because of the importance of the film itself which most agree is a fictionalized biography of newspaper publisher william randolph hearst according to film biographer david thomson however no one can now deny herman mankiewicz credit for the germ shape and pointed language of the screenplay mankiewicz biographer richard meryman notes that the dispute had various causes including the way the movie was promoted when rko opened the movie on broadway on may 1 1941 followed by showings at theaters in other large cities the publicity programs that were printed included photographs of welles as the one man band directing acting and writing in a letter to his father afterwards mankiewicz wrote i m particulary furious at the the fact is that there is n t one single line in the picture that was n t in writingwriting from and by mebefore ever a camera turned according to film historian otto friedrich it made mankiewicz unhappy to hear welles quoted in louella parsons s column before the question of screen credits was officially settled as saying so i wrote citizen kane mankiewicz went to the screen writers guild and declared that he was the original author welles later claimed that he planned on a joint credit all along but mankiewicz claimed that welles offered him a bonus of ten thousand dollars if he would let welles take full credit the screen writers guild eventually decreed a joint credit with mankiewicz s name first some time later welles commented on this allegation god if i had n t loved him i would have hated him after all those ridiculous stories persuading people i was offering him money to have his name taken off that he would be carrying on around hearst s inner circle he became good friends with hollywood screenwriter charles lederer who was marion davies s nephew lederer grew up as a hollywood habitu spending much time at san simeon where davies reigned as william randolph hearst s mistress as one of his admirers in the early 1930s hearst often invited mankiewicz to spend the weekend at san simeon herman told joe his brother to come to the office of their mutual friend charlie lederer in 1939 he suffered a broken leg in a driving accident and had to be hospitalized during his hospital stay one of his visitors was orson welles who met him earlier and had become a great admirer of his wit during the months after his release from the hospital he and welles began working on story ideas which led to the creation of citizen kane despite welles denial that the film was about hearst few people were convincedincluding hearst after the release of citizen kane for writing the story certain elements in the film were taken from mankiewicz s own experience the sled rosebud was basedaccording to some sourceson a very important bicycle that was stolen from him and some of kane s speeches are almost verbatim copies of hearst s most personally the word rosebud was reportedly hearst s private nickname for davies clitoris hearst s thoughts about the film are unknown what is certain is that his extensive chain of newspapers and radio stations blocked all mentions of the film and refused to accept advertising for it while some hearst employees worked behind the scenes to block or restrict its distribution welles version of events welles insisted that citizen kane was an idea he conceived with mankiewicz that was initially titled the american in addition to hearst the character of charles foster kane was also based on publisher robert mccormick and other media moguls including joseph pulitzer as well as businessman samuel insull who built the civic opera the screenplay s use of multiple narrative perspectives came from joseph conrad s heart of darkness which was a work that welles wanted to film welles himself had a relationship several times removed to hearst as marion davies nephew charles lederer had married welles s ex wife virginia nicolson welles in 1940 lederer became the stepfather of welles daughter welles reportedly gave mankiewicz 300 pages of notes and assigned john houseman to work with him and to ensure mankiewicz stayed sober on welles s instruction houseman wrote the opening narration as a pastiche of the march of time newsreels orson welles explained to peter bogdanovich about the writers working separately by saying i left him on his own finally because we d started to waste too much time haggling so after mutual agreements on storyline and character mank went off with houseman and did his version while i stayed in hollywood and wrote mine taking these drafts welles drastically condensed and rearranged them welles of underplaying mankiewicz s contribution to the script but welles countered the attacks by saying at the end naturally i was the one making the picture after allwho had to make the decisions i used what i wanted of mank s and rightly or wrongly kept what i liked of my own welles added autobiographical allusions to kane most noticeably in the treatment of kane s childhood and particularly regarding his guardianship welles added features from other famous american lives to create a general and mysterious personality rather than the narrow journalistic portrait drawn by mankiewicz academy award celebration citizen kane was nominated for an academy award in every possible category including best original screenplay meryman writes herman insisted he had no chance to win though the hollywood reporter had given the film first place in ten of its twelve divisions the fear of hearst he felt was still alive and hollywood s resentment and distrust of welles lived up to his wonderboy ballyhoo neither welles nor mankiewicz attended the dinner which was broadcast on radio welles was in south america filming carnival and herman refused to attend he did not want to be humiliated said his wife sara richard meryman describes the evening on the night of the awards herman turned on his radio and sat in his bedroom chair sara lay on the bed as the screenplay category approached he pretended to be hardly listening suddenly from the radio half screamed came herman j mankiewicz welles s name as coauthor was drowned out by voices all through the audience calling out mank mank where is he and audible above all others was irene selznick where is he george schaefer film producer the film as a whole richard meryman concludes that taken as a whole citizen kane was overwhelmingly welles s film a triumph of intense personal magic herman that were mined by welles but one marvels at the debt those two self destroyers owe to each other without welles there would have been no supreme moment for herman without mankiewicz there would have been no perfect idea at the perfect time for welles to confirm his genius the citizen kane script was true creative symbiosis a partnership greater than the sum of its parts other films mankiewicz wrote and co wrote many other major screenplays including the original version of gentlemen prefer blondes and the pride of the yankees dinner at eight and pride of st louis death mankiewicz was an alcoholic once famously admonishing his hostess at a formal

what is known simply as a teller in the united states a chief cashier was a very high level position able to among other duties issue cashier s checks against the bank s reserves in view of his later career in banking it seems likely that davis attained that level of responsibility it is known that lacking much formal schooling he also followed a program of diligent self education he reportedly spent a brief stint in the united states navy attaining the rank of petty officer first class after distinguished service in the philippines according to later accounts davis continued to suffer the ill effects of his time in the mines coupled with his intense efforts on and off the job deteriorating health finally forced him to take a year or so off for a rest cure idaho banker and governor in 1903 davis s first wife the former florence o gilliland whose father owned a bank that merged with the one where davis worked the following year the couple moved to american falls idaho which he had apparently observed during his rest cure in 1907 davis helped organize the first national bank of american falls over the next several years he aggressively promoted the town and its farm interests at some point davis parents followed him to american falls where his father lived until his death in 1913 davis also became very active in the republican party united states in idaho in 1912 he served as a delegate to the republican national convention he also served as a member of the idaho state senate from 1913 to 1915 davis won the republican nomination for governor in 1916 but was narrowly defeated by the democratic incumbent moses alexander davis was nominated again in 1918 and defeated democrat h f samuels ex governor james h hawley said that for various reasons a great many of the old time democrats won by a margin of 57 626 to 38 499 votes he was reelected in 1920 although the election was a three way race davis received 53 percent of the votes out polling his nearest rival by 75 748 to 38 509 during his tenure funding was sanctioned for the establishment of the bureau of budget and taxation plus a veteran s welfare program and a teacher s pension system a road building program was initiated the state s statutes were reorganized the state s administrative agencies were unified and three constitutional amendments were sanctioned davis left office on january 1 1923 other interests and later career along with his political career davis stayed heavily involved with banking even after he moved to boise when he was first elected as governor that interest led to his election as president of the idaho state bankers association in 1918 davis also took an active interest in irrigation projects especially those promoted by the carey act along the snake river during his term as governor davis organized a meeting states to discuss water issues out of that meeting grew the western states reclamation association to provide a united voice for advice to the u s government on federally funded irrigation projects two months after davis left the governor s office he was appointed as a special assistant to the secretary of the interior to supervise the united states reclamation service renamed the bureau of reclamation in 1923 and served until 1924 he then served from 1924 to 1932 as director of finance for the interior department and for a short time in 1931 as a special advisor to president herbert hoover after his service with the federal government davis returned to his idaho banking interests and also expanded his investments in mining ventures

meal sometimes augmented with almond oil or extract it is often made into sweets common uses are marzipan filled chocolate and small marzipan imitations of fruits and vegetables it is also rolled into thin sheets and glazed for icing cakes primarily birthday and wedding cakes and christmas cakes this use is particularly common in england on large fruitcakes marzipan or almond paste may also be used as a cake ingredient as in stollen in some countries it is shaped into small figures of animals as a traditional treat for new year s day marzipan is also used in tortell and in some versions of king cake eaten during the carnival season traditional swedish princess cake is typically covered with a layer of marzipan that has been tinted pale green around the world southern europe in italy particularly in palermo marzipan new world in latin american cuisine marzipan is europe in the netherlands and belgium marzipan figures are given as presents to children during sinterklaas middle east in the middle east marzipan known as lozina which is derived from the word the arabic word for almonds is flavored with orange flower water and shaped into roses and other delicate flowers before they are baked marzipan can also be made from oatmeal farina or semolina in iran marzipan fruit is a traditional passover treat replacing cookies and cakes india and east asia in the indian state of goa the goan catholic dish mazpon replaces almonds with cashew nuts in the philippines spanish for pili marzipan is made from pili nuts history there are proposed two lines for its origin they are not necessarily contradictory and may be complementary as there have always been mediterranean trade and cooking influences in both cases there is a reason to believe that there is were under muslim control other sources establish the origin of marzipan in china from where the recipe moved on to the middle east and then to europe through al andalus northeast mediterranean line although it is believed to have originated in persia present day iran and to have been introduced to europe through the turks badem ezmesi in turkish and most notably produced in edirne there is some dispute between hungary and italy over its origin marzipan became a specialty of the baltic sea region of germany in particular the city of lbeck has a proud tradition of marzipan manufacture lbecker marzipan pgi the city s manufacturers like niederegger still guarantee their marzipan to contain two thirds almonds by weight which results in a product of highest quality historically the city of knigsberg in east prussia was renowned for its distinctive marzipan production knigsberg marzipan remains a special type of marzipan in germany that is golden brown on its surface and sometimes embedded 1193 known as panis martius or marzapane i e march bread iberian peninsula line another possible geographic origin is in spain then known as al andalus in toledo 850 900 though more probably 1150 during the reign of alfonso vii this specialty was known as postre regio instead of mazapn and there are also mentions in the book of one thousand and one nights of an almond paste eaten during ramadan and as an aphrodisiac mazapn is toledo s most famous dessert often created for christmas and has pgi status almonds have to be at least 50 of the total weight following the directives of mazapn de toledo regulator counseil another idea to support this line is the important tradition of another spanish almond based christmas confectionery the turron under eu law marzipan must have variations persipan is a similar yet less expensive product kernels many confectionery products sold as marzipan are made from less expensive materials such as soy paste and almond essence german marzipan is made by grinding whole almonds with sugar and partially drying the paste and french marzipan called massepain is made by combining ground almonds with sugar syrup some marzipan is flavored with rosewater spanish marzipan is made without bitter almonds etymology the german name has largely ousted the original english name marchpane with the same apparent derivation march bread the word marchpane occurs in shakespeare s romeo and juliet act 1 scene 5 line 9 marzapane is documented earlier in italian than in any other language and the sense bread for pan is romance the origin could be from the latin term martius panis which means bread of march however the ultimate etymology is unclear for example itself from greek maza meaning pastry and pan meaning bread this can be particularly seen in the provenal massapan the portuguese maapo where is an alternative form for the phoneme ss and old spanish mazapn the change from ss to z in latin words was common in old spanish and the r appeared later though it could also be derived from martis pan bread of march among the other possible etymologies set forth in the oxford english dictionary one theory proposes that the word marzipan may be a corruption of martaban a burmese city famous for its jars the real academia espaola suggests the idea of the spanish word mazapn to be derived from the hispanic arabic pim which is derived from the greek another source could be from arabic mawthbn king who sits still the arabic latinized as matapanus was used to these coins were stored in ornate boxes from about the fifteenth century when the coins were no longer in circulation the boxes became decorative containers for storing and serving luxury sweetmeats one such luxury that crept into the box in the sixteenth century is the now famous almond flavored marzipan named at least proximately after the box in which it was stored however if marzipan has its origin in persia it is not unlikely that the name may come from marzban in persian derived from the words marz meaning border or boundary and the suffix bn meaning guardian a class of margraves or military commanders in charge of border provinces of the sassanid empire of persia iran between 3rd and 7th centuries ce it is also a possibility that the origin of this dessert and the origin of the term come from different geographical places production to produce marzipan raw almonds are cleaned by sieving air elutriation and other electronic or mechanical devices then immersed in water five minutes this loosens the almond s skin which is removed by passing the almonds through rubber covered rotating cylinders they are then cooled after which they are coarsely chopped and ground with up to 35 sugar into almond flour the almond flour mixture is roasted and cooled after which sucrose table sugar and possibly a binding agent such as starch syrup or sorbitol are added it may then be molded into any shape joe melson born may 1935 is an american singer and a bmi awardwinning songwriter life and career melson was born in bonham fannin county texas he was reared on a farm until he was sixteen he attended high school in gore oklahoma and in chicago illinois before he returned to texas to study at the two year odessa college in odessa the seat of ector county he studied and played music as a teenager and fronted a rockabilly band called the cavaliers beginning in 1957 first at his home in midland texas and then in nashville tennessee melson teamed up with a virtual unknown roy orbison with whom he would write a string of hits for monument records prior to their collaboration orbison had been solely a rockabilly performer although melson himself was rooted in that music genre he had begun writing rhythm and blues songs melson recognized the potential in orbison s voice encouraging the singer to explore its power through on march 25 1960 was the first operatic rock ballad in the history of popular music the song went to no 2 on the billboard hot 100 chart in the united states and to 1 in the uk singles chart which launched orbison to international musical stardom not only did that song influence orbison to write such operatic ballads as in dreams but a few months later it also induced orbison s friend elvis presley to record it s now or never based on the neapolitan art song o sole mio melson and orbison followed up with similar sounds such as the dramatic running scared that went to 1 in the us the result of their collaborative efforts produced such songs as uptown 1960 only the lonely 1960 blue angel 1960 i m hurtin 1961 running scared 1961 crying 1961 the crowd 1962 the actress 1962 gigolette 1962 blue bayou 1964 lana in 1964 cry softly lonely one 1967 harlem woman 1972 lana was originally written for virgil johnson s the velvets based in odessa orbison also later recorded th song between 1960 and 1963 melson recorded several singles of his own the best known being hey mister cupid for hickory records and also through acuff rose music wrote songs for some of that label s other artists including dan folger he then recorded a few songs for the emp records label in 1964 and 1965 that achieved limited success his last hit collaboration with orbison came in 1963 with the writing of blue bayou although some of their cooperative efforts would be recorded in later years the two got together again between 1971 and 1975 but while the venture did not yield the commercial success their collaboration once had it brought such memorable songs as harlem woman over the years melson continued to perform at rockabilly and nostalgia festivals and in 2002 he was inducted into the river rother may refer to the following rivers in england river rother south yorkshire whose source is at pilsley in

family home of saltwood castle and educated at harrow he was denied a university career after his father suffered heavy financial losses from the wall street crash of 1929 deedes began his career as a reporter on the morning post in 1931 joining the daily telegraph when it took over the post in 1937 between 1931 and the beginning of the war in 1939 he shared a home in bethnal green with his uncle as an officer in the 2nd battalion of the queen s westminsters one of the territorial units of the king s royal rifle corps gaining the military cross near hengelo the netherlands in april 1945 he was also the only officer to serve in 12th king s royal rifle corps 2nd queen s westminsters for the duration of the war his battalion served as the motor battalion of 8 armoured brigade in the nw europe

christian like his father he lived very unpretentiously on the edge of romney marsh kent where his wife hilary kept a menagerie of farm animals he was never particularly well off preferring to use public transport whenever possible his son jeremy deedes is a director of the telegraph group of companies and a director of the tote chairman of the sportsman newspaper and is currently a director of warwick racecourse lucy deedes is a former master of foxhounds and was the first wife of crispin money coutts the 9th baron latymer she is the mother of society magician drummond money coutts politics deedes came from a family with a tradition of public service he was very proud of the fact that there had been a deedes member of parliament in every century since 1600 deedes was elected as the conservative member of parliament mp for ashford in 1950 first serving as a junior minister under winston churchill for three years he later entered harold macmillan s cabinet in 1962 as minister without portfolio he left the cabinet in 1964 as minister of information and subsequently stood down as an mp at the october 1974 election journalism and later life he was editor of the daily telegraph from 1974 to 1986 and after he was replaced by max hastings continued his career as the print unions deedes was made a life peer in 1986 becoming baron deedes of aldington in the county of kent though he always preferred to be addressed as bill rather than lord deedes bill deedes continued to comment on social and political issues through his newspaper columns up to his death in his later years he gained a cult fanbase after two memorable appearances on have i got news for you becoming at the age of 88 the oldest guest ever to have appeared on the programme until 2012 when baroness trumpington appeared at the age of 90 he was also a stalwart member of the carlton club and was appointed as an ambassador for unicef in 1998 running high profile campaigns against landmines in 2006 he wrote an opinion piece for the daily telegraph saying that islam is the only faith on earth that persuades its followers to seek political power and impose a law sharia which shapes everyone s style of life adding that islam forbids muslims into his 94th year with his final article published on 3 august 2007 concerning darfur he died on 17 august 2007 at his home in kent aged 94 after a short illness the residential street bill deedes way in the village of aldington near ashford is named after him popular culture dear bill deedes was close to margaret thatcher and her husband denis the spoof letters from mr thatcher which appeared in satirical magazine private eye throughout the thatcher years were always addressed to dear bill the bill in question was usually assumed to be deedes however some instalments e g 16 may and 28 november 1986 would suggest otherwise the two men regularly played golf together with deedes claiming it was a public service to take the spouse of the prime minister away from the stress of being married to the country s head of government the eye also based its long running editorial comment shome scoop according to many sources deedes was the journalist used by evelyn waugh as the model and inspiration for the hapless william boot protagonist of the satirical novel scoop deedes himself said he spent part of my life brushing aside the charge but admitted that my inexperience and naivety as a reporter in africa might have contributed a few bricks to the building of boot the two had reported together in 1936 trying to cover the second italo abyssinian war deedes arrived in addis ababa aged 22 with almost 600 pounds of luggage berhanu kebele ethiopian ambassador to london pointed out that deedes s sharp journalistic instincts

analytical mechanics specifically the study of the rigid body dynamics of multibody systems the term generalized coordinates refers to the parameters that describe the configuration of the system relative to some reference configuration these parameters must uniquely define the configuration of the system relative to the reference configuration the generalized velocities are the time derivatives of the generalized coordinates of the system an example of a generalized coordinate is the angle that locates a point moving on a circle the adjective generalized distinguishes these parameters from the traditional use of the term coordinate to refer to cartesian coordinates for example describing the location of the point on the circle using x and y coordinates although there may be many choices for generalized coordinates for a physical system parameters are usually selected which are convenient for the specification of the configuration of the system and which make the solution of its equations of motion easier if these parameters are independent of one another then number of independent generalized coordinates is defined by the number of degrees generalized coordinates are usually selected to provide the minimum number of independent coordinates that define the configuration of a system which simplifies the formulation of lagrange s equations of motion however it can also occur that a useful set of generalized coordinates may be dependent which means that they are related by one or more constraint equations holonomic constraints if the constraints introduce relations between the generalized coordinates q sub i sub i 1 n and time of the form math fj q1 qn t 0 j 1 k math they are called holonomic these constraint equations define a manifold in the space of generalized coordinates q sub i sub i 1 n known as the configuration space it can be advantageous to choose independent generalized coordinates as is done in lagrangian mechanics because this eliminates the need for constraint equations however an unconstrained set for example when dealing with nonholonomic constraints or when trying to find the force due to any constraint holonomic or not dependent generalized coordinates must be employed sometimes independent generalized coordinates are called internal coordinates because they are mutually independent otherwise unconstrained and together give the position of the system non holonomic constraints a mechanical system can involve constraints on both the generalized coordinates and their derivatives constraints of this type are known as non holonomic first order non holonomic constraints have the form math gj q1 qn dotq1 dotqn t 0 j 1 k math an example of such a constraint is a rolling wheel or knife edge that constrains the direction of the velocity vector non holonomic constraints can also involve next order derivatives such as generalized accelerations example simple pendulum the relationship between the use of generalized coordinates and cartesian coordinates to characterize the movement of a mechanical system can be illustrated by considering the constrained dynamics of a simple a mass m hanging from a pivot point so that it is constrained to move on a circle of radius l the position of the mass is defined by the coordinate vector r x y measured in the plane of the circle such that y is in the vertical direction the coordinates x and y are related by the equation of the circle math f x y x2 y2 l2 0 math that constrains the movement of m this equation also provides a constraint on the velocity components math dotf x y 2xdotx 2ydoty 0 math now introduce the parameter that defines the angular position of m from the vertical direction it can be used to define the coordinates x and y

fracddtfracpartial tpartial dotx fracpartial tpartial x fx lambda fracpartial fpartial x quad fracddtfracpartial tpartial doty fracpartial tpartial y fy lambda fracpartial fpartial y math this yields the three equations math mddotx lambda 2x quad mddoty mg lambda 2y quad x2 y2 l2 0 math in the three unknowns x y and using the parameter lagrange s equations take the form math fracddtfracpartial tpartial dottheta fracpartial tpartial theta ftheta math which becomes math ml2ddottheta mglsintheta math or math ddottheta fracglsintheta 0 math this formulation yields one equation because there is a single parameter and no constraint equation this shows that the parameter is a generalized coordinate that can be used in the same way as the cartesian coordinates x and y to analyze the pendulum example double pendulum the benefits double pendulum for the two masses m sub i sub i 1 2 let r sub i sub x sub i sub y sub i sub i 1 2 define their two trajectories these vectors satisfy the two constraint equations math f1 x1 y1 x2 y2 mathbfr1cdot mathbfr1 l12 0 quad f2 x1 y1 x2 y2 mathbfr2 mathbfr1 cdot mathbfr2 mathbfr1 l22 0 math the formulation of lagrange s equations for this system yields six equations in the four cartesian coordinates x sub i sub y sub i sub i 1 2 and the two lagrange multipliers sub i sub i 1 2 that arise from the two constraint equations coordinates now introduce the generalized coordinates sub i sub i 1 2 that define the angular position of each mass of the double pendulum from the vertical direction in this case we have math mathbfr1 l1sintheta1 l1costheta1 quad mathbfr2 l2costheta2 math the force of gravity acting on the masses is given by math mathbff1 0 m1 g quad mathbff2 0 m2 g math where g is the acceleration of gravity therefore the virtual work of gravity on the two masses as they follow the trajectories r sub i sub i 1 2 is given by math delta w mathbff1cdotdelta mathbfr1 mathbff2cdotdelta mathbfr2 math the variations r sub i

math mathbfr1 mathbfr1 q1 q2 qm t math math mathbfr2 mathbfr2 q1 q2 qm t math math mathbfrn mathbfrn q1 q2 qm t math this transformation affords the flexibility in dealing with complex systems to use the most convenient and not necessarily inertial coordinates these equations are used to construct differentials when considering virtual displacements and generalized forces examples double pendulum a double pendulum constrained to move in a plane may be described by the four cartesian coordinates sub 1 sub x sub 2 sub y sub 2 sub but the system only has two degrees of freedom and a more efficient system would be to use math lbrace q1 q2 rbrace lbracetheta1 theta2 rbrace math which are defined via the following relations math lbrace x1 y1 rbrace lbrace l1sintheta1 l1costheta1 rbrace math math lbrace x2 y2 rbrace lbrace l1sintheta1 l2sintheta2 l1costheta1 l2costheta2 rbrace math example bead on a wire a bead constrained to move on a wire has only one degree of freedom and the generalized coordinate used to describe its motion is often math q1 l math where l is the distance along the wire from some reference point on the wire notice that a motion embedded in three dimensions has been reduced to only one dimension motion on a surface a point mass constrained to a surface has two degrees of freedom even though its is a sphere a good choice of coordinates would be math lbrace q1 q2 rbrace lbrace theta phi rbrace math where and are the angle coordinates familiar from spherical coordinates the r coordinate has been effectively dropped as a particle moving on a sphere maintains a constant radius generalized velocities and kinetic energy each generalized coordinate math qi math is associated with a generalized velocity math dot qi math defined as math dot qi

this may be written math t sumi 1 p frac mi2 left dot xi2 dot yi2 dot zi2 right math if the transformation equations between the cartesian and generalized coordinates math xi xi left q1 q2 yi yi left q1 q2 qn t right math math zi zi left q1 q2 qn t right math are known then these equations may be differentiated to provide the time derivatives to use in the above kinetic energy equation math dot xi frac ddt xi left q1 q2 qn t right math it is important to remember that the kinetic energy must be measured relative to inertial coordinates if the above method is used it means only that the cartesian coordinates need to be inertial even though the generalized coordinates need not be this is another considerable convenience of the use of generalized coordinates applications of generalized coordinates such coordinates are helpful principally in lagrangian mechanics where the forms of the principal equations describing the motion of the system are unchanged by a shift to generalized coordinates from any other coordinate system the amount of virtual work done along any coordinate math fqi cdot delta qi math center where math fqi math is the generalized force in the math qi math direction while the generalized force is difficult to construct a priori it may be quickly derived by determining the amount of work that would be done by all non constraint forces if the system underwent a virtual displacement of math delta qi math with all other generalized coordinates and time held fixed this will take the form math delta wqi f left q1 q2 qn right cdot delta qi math and the generalized force may then be calculated math fqi frac delta wqidelta qi f left q1 q2 qn right math generalized coordinates and virtual work the principle of virtual work states that if a system is in static equilibrium the virtual work of the applied forces is zero for all virtual movements of the system from this state that is w 0 for any this is equivalent to the requirement that the generalized forces for any virtual displacement are zero that is f sub i sub 0 let the forces on the system be f sub j sub j 1 m be applied to points with cartesian coordinates r sub j sub j 1 m then the virtual work generated by a virtual displacement from the equilibrium position is given by math delta w sumj 1m mathbffjcdot deltamathbfrj math where r sub j sub j 1 m denote the virtual

1978 he later moved to ottawa to attend carleton university and graduated in 1983 with a bachelor of public affairs degree from the school of journalism and communications he entered the federal public service and rose to the position of director of communications for the speaker of the house of commons municipal politics in ottawa city council jim watson first entered public office in 1991 when he was he was subsequently re elected to council in 1994 in 1992 watson championed a roll back of salaries and operating costs at the city level his first direct action against excessive city spending was his unilateral decision to donate his yearly 2 salary increase totaling 700 to charity in addition as part of the re election process watson donated his severance pay of 5200 to four local charities after moving from regional to city council in 1994 during his second term as councilor watson reduced his own salary by 13 from 51 000 to 45 000 while voting to reduce the mayors office budget and salary in 1996 he supported dalton mcguinty s bid to lead the ontario liberal party first mayoral term in 1997 watson sought election as mayor of ottawa winning 83 per cent of the popular vote to become ottawa s mayor during his term as mayor watsons emphasis centered on ensuring that the city adopt sustainable fiscal management policies which would enable overall operating costs to go down while reducing budget deficits and the citys 2000 to become president and ceo of the canadian tourism commission after municipal politics in 2003 watson left public service to pursue a career in journalism as host of chro tv s the new ro noon he was also a regular contributor to the ottawa radio station cfra and the ottawa citizen watson has served on the board or as honorary

park s official liaison with ontario s municipalities watson was able to implement a substantive policy designed to support the uploading of property tax supported programs from the budgets of ontarios municipalities to that of the provincial budget under this policy the province will take back 1 5 billion worth of programs funded by ontarios municipalities by 2018 reversing previous downloading of provincial responsibilities which occurred during mike harris tenure as premier as a result of this uploading of associated costs to the province the estimated benefit to ottawa is approximately 122 million furthermore the up loads are projected to reduce ottawas social program costs by over 18 7 million in addition watson signed the federal provincial housing agreement in 2008 the largest housing agreement of its kind to date cabinet posts second mayoral term on january 12 2010 watson resigned from cabinet in order to run for mayor of ottawa in the with almost 50 of the

and cut his office budget by 10 he also enacted a set of integrity and transparency measures including hiring an integrity commissioner launching a lobbyist registry and requiring that elected officials office expenses be posted online watson froze community recreation fees for three years and reduced the size of the citys workforce twice the first times it had been done since amalgamation watson and city council also invested 340 million in infrastructure renewal such as roads sidewalks pathways and sewers and record amount in cycling initiatives watson helped advance two major city building projects that had stalled for a number of years the revitalization of lansdowne park and the introduction of light rail transit in october 2012 city council approved the final lansdowne park plan an agreement with the ottawa sports and green space and housing and retail added to the site in december 2012 city council voted unanimously to move forward with the confederation line a 12 5 km

company located in graz austria the company was founded in 1889 by the industrialist johann puch and produced automobiles bicycles mopeds and motorcycles pre 1919 johann puch first produced bicycles in 1889 in a small workshop called fahrradfabrikation strauchergasse 18 a in graz ten years later he founded his company erste steiermrkische fahrradfabrik ag en first styrian bicycle factory ag puch s company became successful through innovation and quality handicraft rapidly expanding over time it soon began producing motorcycles and mopeds the main production plant later called einser werk was constructed in the south of graz in the district of puntigam production of engines was started in 1901 and cars followed in 1904 in 1906 the production of the two cylinder puch voiturette began and in 1909 a puch car broke the world high speed record with 130 4 km h in 1910 puch is known to have produced sedans for members of the horsepower type viii alpenwagen was developed in 1912 johann puch went into retirement and became the company s honorary president in that year the company employed about 1 100 workers and produced 16 000 bicycles and over 300 motorcycles and cars annually during world war i puch became an important vehicle supplier to the austro hungarian army however with the collapse of the empire following the war the market for automobiles shrank and production was discontinued between wars in 1923 an italian engineer giovanni marcellino is said to have been sent by the banks to wind up the puch factory in graz instead of which within a few weeks he had settled down to live in the town designing and then producing a new version of the split single taking his inspiration from industrial counter piston engines the new engine benefited from the improved breathing of the italian original to which he added asymmetric port timing in 1931 puch won the german grand prix with a supercharged split single though in subsequent years the split singles with austro daimler and became a part of the new austro daimler puchwerke this company in its turn merged in 1934 with steyr ag to form steyr daimler puch wwii like all enterprises of its kind the puch production plants had to change to arms production during world war ii the existing capacity was insufficient therefore a second plant was constructed and opened in 1941 in thondorf graz in the three original assembly halls luxury vehicles for the american market were produced steyr daimler puch is one of the companies known to have benefited from slave labor housed in the mauthausen gusen concentration camp system during world war ii slaves from the camp who had initially been worked to death in quarries started to be used in a highly profitable system used by 45 engineering and war effort companies and amongst them puch had an underground factory built at gusen in 1943 post war years during the period immediately after the war late 1945 to 1947 the factory was requisitioned and run by the british army r e m e who used the facilities servicing of british and american military vehicles in 1949 an assembly cooperation agreement was signed with fiat in turin the 1950s to the mid 1970s saw a sharp increase in production of motorcycles bicycles and mopeds even though puch was a part of steyr daimler puch it still produced products under its own name as well as for steyr puch and other companies puch gave up racing in the 1950s and split single production ended around 1970 1953 puch launched two new motorcycles the 125 and 175 sv 1954 the very successful ms 50 moped was launched 1957 the legendary puch 500 small car came on the market 1958 production of the steyr puch haflingers started 16 657 vehicles are produced in total and exported into 110 countries 1966

where puch designed and built the four wheel drive mechanics for the fiat panda 4x4 mk1 puch scooters the late 1950s saw strong sales of the puch 125cc two stroke single motorscooters which had three gears shifted from the left twistgrip these machines developed a reputation for reliability and were popular for daily commuting providing good weather protection and ease of use in this role their moderate performance with a top speed of models had a 150cc engine and foot operation giving better performance of 6 hp instead of 5 hp but retaining the three gears puch mopeds puch produced the puch maxi puch newport and mk mopeds which were popular from the late 1970s to early 1980s in austria and the netherlands puch mopeds played a big role in the 1960s popular culture puch mopeds in sweden

invader and trak pro in 1981 they worked with speed unlimited in wayne new jersey to manufacture a line of high end bmx race bikes speed unlimited also made bikes for hutch and their own brand thruster the model they made for puch was the trak pro in 1981 puch also began sponsoring bmx racers across the united states the green black and white uniform was soon showing up at bmx tracks across america especially in the northeast you can see a collection of puch s at the puch maxi the maxi is one of puch s most well known machines along with the magnum and newport models the puch maxi is a moped fitted with a single cylinder 49cc two stroke engine rider at speeds of 28 mph 48 km h it was started using the pedals which could be engaged and disengaged from the engine via a starting lever so it could be ridden as a normal bicycle later models did not have pedals and instead were started with a kick start mechanism puch motorcycle marketed as the twingle legacy in the late 1980s the

soft rock or light rock is a style of music which uses the techniques of rock music often combined with elements from folk rock to compose a softer more toned down sound history hard rock had been established as a mainstream genre by 1965 from the end of the 1960s it became common to divide mainstream rock music into soft and hard rock with both emerging as major radio formats in the us soft rock was often derived from folk rock using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies major artists included carole king cat stevens the hollies james taylor and bread soft rock songs generally tend to focus on themes like love everyday life and relationships the genre tends to make heavy use of acoustic guitars pianos synthesizers and sometimes saxophones the

sherlock holmes holmes and watson are called to a house in deptford due to the concerns of a young woman about her safety several of her relatives have died in the past few years of heart attacks a relative who trains canaries also lives in the house holmes is not able to detect anything amiss until he and watson are en route home but he suddenly solves the mystery and returns to deptford to save the life of the young woman from a death by heart failure for a time we sat in silence our cab had reached the beginnings of the city and i was gazing out of the window my fingers drumming idly

now lay an intricate tracery of whorls and lines where my finger had wandered aimlessly holmes clapped his hand to his brow and throwing open the other window he shouted an order to the cabby this

synchronized transmission and management of multi channel digital audio video control signals and multi port midi over a network description the mlan protocol was originally developed by yamaha corporation and publicly introduced in january 2000 it was available under a royalty free license to anyone interested in utilizing the technology mlan exploits several features of the ieee 1394 firewire standard such as isochronous transfer and intelligent connection management there are two versions of the mlan protocol version 1 requires s200 rate while version 2 requires s400 rate and supports synchronized streaming of digital audio at up to 24 bit word length and 192 khz sample rate midi and wordclock at a bitrate up to 400 megabits per second with the proper driver software a computer based digital audio workstation can interact with mlan compliant hardware via any ohci compliant firewire port mlan consumes the entire bus bandwidth when operating and non mlan devices can not share the same firewire connection so it or other sound devices on the same firewire bus when mlan manager software is running the transport layers of mlan have been standardized as iec 61883 end

pilots such as important notams pilots usually listen to an available atis broadcast before contacting the local control unit in order to reduce the controllers workload and relieve frequency congestion the recording is updated in fixed intervals or when there is a significant change in the information e g a change in the active runway it is given a letter designation e g bravo from the icao spelling alphabet the letter progresses down the alphabet with every update and starts at alpha after a break in service of 12 hours or more when contacting the local control unit a pilot will indicate he she has information letter where letter is the atis identification letter atc controller to verify whether the pilot has all the current information sample messages example 1 see metar for

the book of the law of the lord is a book accepted as scripture by the church of jesus christ of latter day saints strangite it is alleged to be a translation by the strangite prophet james strang of the plates of laban originally acquired by nephi a leading character in the early portion of the book of mormon strang claimed to have translated them using the urim and thummim which was used by joseph smith to translate the book of mormon however the book of the law of the lord bears little resemblance to the material described in the book of mormon as being engraved on the plates of laban rather strang s book comprises a rather elaborate constitution for a mormon kingdom in which the prophet leader of the latter day saint church equally rules as king over god s kingdom on earth it also contains various other revelations and teachings unique to strang james j strang james j strang was a lawyer and newspaper editor from new york who converted in 1844 shortly after his baptism joseph smith jr founder of the church was murdered by a mob upon smith s death a number of individuals came forward claiming a divine mandate to lead his church including strang as a recent convert strang did not possess the name recognition among rank and file mormons held by brigham young and sidney rigdon two other contenders for lds leadership hence he faced an uphill battle in his quest to be recognized as the heir to smith s prophetic mantle to advance his cause strang asserted that unlike rigdon and young he had hard evidence of his prophetic calling in september 1845 he announced the discovery of the voree record the final testament of an ancient native american engraved on three brass plates dug up near voree wisconsin his headquarters at the time however strang s claims to possession of divinely revealed ancient records and the ability to correctly translate them did not end there in book of the law of the lord a far more substantial work alleged provenance of the book strang explained that the book of the law as it is often callednot to be confused with aleister crowley s book of the same title was kept in the ark of the covenant and was held too sacred to go into the hands of strangers however when the septuagint translation was made the book of the law was kept back and lost to the jewish nation in the time that they were subject to foreign powers thus the various books in the pentateuch containing abstracts of some of the laws have been read instead of it until even the existence of the book has come to be a matter of doubt strangites believe that their book of the law is identical to the one mentioned in the bible they also identify the book of the law with the stick of judah mentioned in this is in marked contrast to other latter day as the bible the lds and community of christ churches the two largest factions of the latter day saint movement each reject james strang s claims to prophetic leadership and his book of the law of the lord witnesses seven witnesses testified to having seen and handled the plates that strang claimed to possess they described them as being eighteen in number each measuring approximately seven and three eighths inches wide by nine inches long their brazen surfaces were occasionally embellished with beautiful pictures and all appeared to be of beautiful antique workmanship bearing a striking resemblance to the ancient oriental languages the witnesses names were samuel graham samuel p bacon warren post phineas wright albert n hosmer ebenezer page and jehiel savage wright and post served as apostles under strang warren post wrote in his journal that the plates weighed approximately six pounds although some of these witnesses later left strang s church none of them is known to have ever denied their the subsequent history of strang s plates of laban and their current whereabouts is a mystery editions of 1851 and 1856 the book of the law of the lord was published in two separate editions during james strang s lifetime the first edition of 1851 contained only eighty pages and consisted of material translated directly from the plates of laban with five exceptions three revelations given to strang and two sections written by inspiration of god in contrast the edition of 1856 comprised 320 pages including all of the text in the 1851 edition plus ten new chapters and a series of notes added by strang to explain the text the 1856 edition is the one generally used by strangites today it was never bound with a title page or preface subsequent reprints have used the title page testimony and preface from the 1851 edition in fact the 1856 edition was not bound at all until after strang s death as he was assassinated before this was completed its uncut strang s disciples both editions of the book of the law are dated according to the year of james strang s reign the 1851 edition is annotated a r i while the 1856 edition carries the date a r vi monarchy and priesthood the most distinctive element of the book of the law is its overtly monarchial tone also of interest are the singular subdivisions strang makes within the melchizedek priesthood which his book refers to as the priesthood of an endless life and the aaronic priesthood referred to as the priesthood of life in the melchizedek priesthood strang enumerates two orders that of apostles and that of priests apostles are subdivided into four degrees the prophet president of the strangite church is openly referred to throughout the book as a king rather than as a president as under joseph smith his counselors are designated as viceroys viceroys are referred to as kings too though this does not indicate a share in the unique royal dignity accorded to in his kingdom forever the leader of strang s apostles is designated as prince and grand master of the seventies a quorum of evangelists not to be confused with the lds and community of christ office of patriarch is established to be apostles to a single nation kindred tongue or people unlike the twelve who were sent to all nations seven evangelists formed a quorum and strang noted that such a body had never been organized in this dispensation this priesthood office was unique to the strangite organization and does not correspond in any way to the office of evangelist found in some other latter day saint churches priests are subdivided into two degrees high priests were to include all inferiour kings patriarchs or heads of tribes and nobles or heads of clans furthermore strang continued they who hold it are called sons of god from this group said the book of the law the king was to select counsellors judges offices of seventy and elder as generally constituted in joseph smith s church in the aaronic priesthood strang enumerates three orders priests were to teach preach and baptize but not as in the doctrine and covenants to bless the sacrament that was reserved to the high priests of the melchizedek priesthood they were subdivided into two courses one of which the singers was opened to women sacrificators who were to kill sacrifices in accordance with appropriate provisions of the book of the law see below under animal sacrifice and singers who were to sing during the various services to be held in strangite temples no such temple was ever constructed by the strangites nor were its services ever apparently composed teachers were not merely to instruct in spiritual matters but secular ones as well they were to staff schools throughout strang s kingdom this office like the office of priest singer was opened to women and was subdivided into five degrees deacons were to serve as stewards and keepers of the kings prisons and stewards of the kings courts they were subdivided into three degrees marshals stewards and ministers in addition a king s council and a king s court were established while no direct link is made between the king s court and the high council established in the doctrine and covenants certain parallels exist such as requiring all members to hold the high priesthood and limiting their number to twelve although strang briefly enjoyed the services of apostle william smith as chief patriarch of his church he makes no mention of this office anywhere in his book the decalogue another unique feature of the book of the law is its version of the decalogue the ten commandments allegedly given to moses on sinai strang s rendering is different from any other jewish catholic islamic or protestant version for it offers a commandment none of the others has thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself that no other version of the decalogue contains more than nine commandments he equally speculates that his fourth commandment was lost perhaps as early as josephus time circa 37 100 a d c e ordination of women as noted above the book of the law opened two priesthood offices to women priest and teacher while only the course of singer in the office of priest was open to females all five degrees in the office of teacher were available furthermore they could serve as leaders of the singers strang ordained women to these ministries as early as 1851 and permitted them to lecture in his school of the prophets by 1856 in contrast the community of christ church opened its ministry to females in 1984 while the lds church does not ordain women to priesthood offices animal sacrifice animal sacrifice was instituted in the book of the law both for forgiveness of sins and as a part of strangite celebration rituals however given the prohibition on sacrifices for sin contained in rather he focused on sacrifice as an element of religious celebration especially the commemoration of his own coronation as king july 8 1850 the head of every house from the king to his lowest subject was to offer a heifer or a lamb or a dove every man a clean beast or a clean fowl according to his household the killing of sacrifices was a prerogative of strangite priests but female priests were specifically barred from participating in this aspect of the priestly office firstfruits offerings were also demanded of all strangite agricultural harvests animal sacrifices are no longer practiced by the strangites though belief in their correctness is still required monotheism and the vocation of jesus christ some of the teachings in the book of the law differed substantially from those held by other mormon sects for instance in his note on the sacrifice of christ and the true god strang rejected both the traditional christian doctrine of the virgin birth of jesus christ gods he insisted that there was but one eternal god the father and that progression to godhood a doctrine allegedly taught by joseph smith was impossible god had always been god said strang and he was one person not three as in the traditional christian trinity jesus christ said strang was the natural born son of mary and joseph who was chosen from before all time to be the savior of mankind but who had to be born as an ordinary mortal of two human parents rather than being begotten by the father or the holy spirit to be able to truly fulfill his messianic role strang claimed that the earthly christ was in essence adopted as god s son at birth and fully revealed as such during the transfiguration after proving himself to god by living a perfectly sinless life he was enabled to provide an acceptable sacrifice for the sins of men prior to his resurrection and ascension furthermore strang denied that god could do some things were as impossible for him as for us thus he saw no essential conflict between science and religion and while he never openly championed evolution he did state that god was limited in his power by both the matter he was working with and by the eons of time required to organize and shape it he spoke glowingly of a future generation who would make religion a science to be studied by as exact rules as mathematicks the mouth of the seer will be opened strang prophesied and the whole earth enlightened musing at length on the nature of sin and evil strang wrote that of all things that god could give to man he could never give him experience thus if free agency were to be real said strang humanity must be given the opportunity to fail and to learn from its own mistakes the ultimate goal for each human being was to willingly conform oneself to the revealed character of god in every respect preferring or desire for reward but rather on account of the innate loveliness of undefiled goodness of pure unalloyed holiness other distinctive teachings the book of the law taught the seventh day sabbath and commanded it in lieu of sunday it also accredits baptism for the dead but on a far more limited scale than that currently practiced by the lds church baptisms for the dead are not performed by the strangites today although belief in the doctrine is still affirmed eternal marriage is taught in the book of the law though it is not required to be performed in a temple as in the lds church strangite priests elders high priests or apostles of all four degrees may all perform this ceremony eternal marriages are still contracted in the strangite church today oaths are taken very seriously in the book of the law and severe spiritual penalties are forewarned upon all who break their solemn word once given the book of the law permits not only the blessing this is not to be done in anger nor indiscriminately rather it is only to be invoked on such as on deliberate and candid thought are found condemned to them by the law of god and then the curse should be invoked as in the presence of god the searcher of hearts conscious that whosoever curses in the bitterness of his corrupt heart and not in the light of gods truth the curse will return upon him maledictions are also to be performed by strangite leaders upon hereticks schismaticks and those guilty of gross and abominable immoralities and acts of great cruelty and wickedness the strangite practice of maledictions seems comparable to the anathemas pronounced in the new testament and by the roman catholic and eastern orthodox churches conservation of forests and resources is mandated in the book of the law groves of trees were to be maintained upon each farm and in each village and town farms and cities without trees were required to plant them and to establish there to rest and to play strangites are prohibited by the book of the law from dressing ostentatiously various today mostly obsolete styles are banned though allowance is made for those who are sojourning among gentiles to imitate to some moderate extent their foolish and ridiculous styles to avoid impertinent observations the book of the law sanctions marriage only between persons who are not impotent deformed of reduced stature a dwarf or mentally handicapped the image of animal husbandry is invoked the same means which will improve a breed of cattle strang wrote will improve a race of men polygamy plural marriage is sanctioned though not expressly commanded in the book of the law the applicable text reads thou shalt not take unto thee a multitude of wives disproportioned to thy inheritance and thy substance nor shalt thou take wives to vex those thou hast neither shalt thou put away one to take another any wife already married to the prospective polygamist even to object but not to veto the marriage this passage seems to offer any aggrieved wife an appeal to the judges but how this was to be carried out is not made clear strang s defense of polygamy was rather novel he claimed that far from enslaving or demeaning women it liberated and elevated them by allowing them to choose the best possible mate based upon any factors deemed important to themeven if that mate were already married to someone else rather than being forced to wed corrupt and degraded sires due to the scarcity of more suitable men a woman could wed the one she saw as the most compatible to herself the best candidate to father her children and the man who could give her the best possible life no matter how many other wives he might have the practice of plural marriage has never been officially proscribed in the strangite church unlike in the lds church only twenty two men entered into polygamy and most of them only took one additional wife member in his church polygamy was apparently practiced by a few strangites up to 1880 or so to include wingfield w watson a strangite high priest who knew and served under james strang personally however with federal and state bans on the practice and a divine injunction to obey the law of the land plural marriage has been given up in the contemporary strangite church though belief in its correctness is still required and affirmed strangites reject section 132 of the lds doctrine and covenants regarding it as a forgery from 1852 that was never received or approved by joseph smith telebit was a us based modem manufacturer known for their trailblazer series of high speed modems one of the first modems to routinely exceed 9600 bit s speeds the trailblazer used a proprietary modulation scheme that proved highly resilient to interference earning the product an almost legendary reputation for reliability despite mediocre or worse line quality they were particularly common in unix installations in the 1980s and 1990s startup telebit was founded by paul baran one of the inventors of the packet switching networking concept baran had recently started a networking company known as packet technologies on bubb road in cupertino california which was working on systems for interactive television while working there he hit on the idea for a new way to implement high speed modems and started telebit across the street packet technologies was a major beta customer for telebit in late 1985 packet technologies later failed and several of their employees were folded into telebit while most of the others formed stratacom makers of the first asynchronous transfer trailblazer negotiating and communicating in contrast to then existing itu telecommunication standardization sector itu t v series protocols such as the common 2400 bit s v 22bis the trailblazers proprietary packetized ensemble protocol pep modulation employed a large number initially up to 512 of closely spaced carrier frequencies each modulated at 6 baud encoding 0 2 4 or 6 bits per interval under favorable conditions the devices could reach data rates of 6 baud x 6 bits per baud x 512 carriers 18432 bits per second if a particular carrier was distorted attenuated or interfered with it could be turned off allowing the data rate to degrade gracefully with decreasing line quality most modems of the era were set up with both channels with equal speed full duplex or in the case where data was primarily sent in one direction with a single high speed channel half duplex the trailblazer instead allowed any one of its 512 channels to be assigned to transfer data the modem was designed to use most of the bandwidth in a single direction with a relatively low speed reverse channel the modems at the two ends of the connection would negotiate line turnarounds reversing the directions of the high speed and low speed channels based on the amount of data queued for transmission in each modem while this adaptive duplex scheme was able to send large files quickly for users accustomed to having the distant computer echo characters the delay associated with having the dsps take turns using the bandwidth tended make interactive typing difficult as there could be as much as a second and a half delay for a single character echo this also caused problems for file transfer protocols e g uucp g or kermit where a small packet of data was sent by one computer followed by a wait for acknowledgment from the receiver send and wait the trailblazer addressed this problem through a technique known as protocol spoofing when the local computer sent a packet to the modem for ack tt message generated locally this fooled the computer into thinking the packet had already reached the far end prompting it to send another packet the error correction normally being applied in the protocol was instead handled using a proprietary replacement protocol operating on top of the mnp error correcting protocols to talk to the remote modem in general spoofing worked well with any protocol that used small packets and thus generated lots of tt ack tt messages initially uucp and support for xmodem and kermit followed support for these features did not come easily the trailblazer plus for instance used a motorola 68000 to drive its electronics this meant that the trailblazers were generally very expensive however its spoofing ability made the trailblazer modems extremely popular in the unix world as it could dramatically improve uucp throughput even at low connection speeds on very noisy lines improvements of over 7 times faster than a 2400 bit s modem were not uncommon sites that required long distance telephone calls to exchange uucp mail could fairly quickly the trailblazers also introduced an extensive set of commands for setting up its various options while most of the simple commands were based on the hayes command set like dialing a number or hanging up a phone their proprietary capabilities were supported by proprietary commands and syntax most of these took the form of code register code value pairs leading to extremely long and almost undecipherable setup strings in 1988 telebit added the t1000 essentially a trailblazer limited to a lower speed 9600 bit s version of pep remaining compatible at that speed with existing trailblazers the t2000 added support for synchronous communications typically used between mainframe computers the original trailblazer t1000 and t2000 were backwards compatible with the 2400 bit s v 22bis standard allowing them to connect with what was then the most common modem speed when talking to other brands of modems netblazer another telebit product was the first on demand internet dialup router the netblazer the product was developed by a team led by mike ballard formerly of and president in 1992 the original netblazer was a standard pc with a serial card connected to user supplied external modems by serial cables later smaller versions the pn and sti were offered which consisted of a small form factor pc combined with custom software and one of a variety of modems or other connection systems isdn etc combined into a large modem like box administrators connected to it via ethernet which was also used for maintenance commands and setup in its first release the netblazer software supported tcp ip using slip but a later upgrade added point to point protocol ppp and support for ipx and appletalk the protocol stack was a commercially licensed version of ka9q later versions of the hardware switched from the intel 80386 to a low cost microcontroller version of the motorola 68030 the mc68en360 increasing speeds telebit had their initial public offering in april 1990 which raised about 20 2 million it traded on nasdaq with the symbol tbit the first multi company standard for 9600 bit s dialup modems was v 32 but rockwell introduced modules and eventually entire chipsets that brought the prices down telebit first offered v 32 support in the t2500 which used the trailblazer t2000 hardware with the addition of the rockwell v 32 modem module a version without pep support was offered as the t1500 the later t1600 had basically the same feature set as the t1500 but used telebit s own v 32 implementation rather than the rockwell module resulting in reduced production cost and better performance both the t1500 and t1600 had list prices over 1000 at the time a 1st tier product from hayes or u s robotics usr generally cost about 700 the v 32bis standard increasing the bit rate to 14 400 bit s was introduced in 1991 in this case rockwell quickly released a v 32bis chipset appearing on the market so rapidly that rockwell based systems generally pre dated implementations from other companies rockwell also aggressively priced the v 32bis product line allowing modems based on them to sell at price points around 300 the point formerly held by 2400 bit s models capabilities all of the 1st tier companies had serious difficulties adapting to a market that was now filled with low cost modems with similar or better performance and features than their own high end models telebit started slipping in terms of relative performance while still trying to sell their products at their traditional high price points they finally introduced the t3000 with v 32bis but without pep though a pep upgrade was planned instead telebit re released it in early 1994 as the 1 099 worldblazer model essentially a t3000 with the new 23 000 bit s turbopep mode an upgrade from the t3000 to worldblazer was sold consisting of two firmware roms and a pal chip there were some design studies of a possible full duplex pep using echo cancellation as is used in v 32 and this technology was proposed to the ccitt now known as the itu t for possible adoption as the v fast modem standard however more conventional modem technology was chosen and standardized as v 34 telebit deemed full duplex pep to require more engineering effort than was justified introduced this feature the octocom merger and the fastblazer v 34 modem the ccitt moved quickly to improve on v 32bis and by 1993 it was clear that the ratification process for their new 28 800 bit s v 34 standard was going to be finalized in 1994 companies lined up to start production of new v 34 designs some going so far to introduce models based on interim standards such as v fc telebit s modem engineering team developed a plan for a v 34 modem but the executive staff believed that it was important to get a product to market more quickly to that end they began looking for other modem companies to acquire and in january 1993 announce that telebit would acquire octocom systems a small privately held modem company in massachusetts octocom had a v 34 modem in development which was expected to be ready for shipment quickly almost all modem engineering activities at telebit s california offices ceased though netblazer engineering continued to be based in california until the end of 1995 the telebit fastblazer 8840 v 34 modem first introduced it did not include v 34 support with management stating that they could n t do so because the standard was not yet ratified although this was true for one month anyway it was ratified in june the fastblazer did not ship with an interim standard either even at amp t s largely ignored 19 200 bit s v 32terbo would only be available as a post release upgrade in july there were no plans to support the widespread v fc at all and no date was set for full v 34 support other than two or three months making matters worse the fastblazer did n t include fax support while telebit stated that an upgrade to add this would be available they also stated they would be charging for it nor would the fastblazer support pep which although by then a minor consideration for most potential buyers was still a differentiator for telebit s existing installed base for sites with a telebit modem on at least one end of a link a pep capable upgrade might be worthwhile without pep v 34 modem all this for an introductory price of 1 399 when v 32bis faxmodems were available for 200 or less and industrial quality v 34 designs were soon available for under 500 it took seven months before telebit introduced v 34 support in january 1995 also releasing the 399 teleblazer low end model at the same time by this point even long time supporters were publicly pooh poohing the company on the usenet the medium that originally drove the widespread adoption of the trailblazer next phase late in 1993 telebit completed their merger with octocom the idea being to use octocom s chelmsford massachusetts manufacturing capability downsizing the existing sunnyvale office to become a netblazer development site the sunnyvale facility was closed to reduce costs higher than expected operating costs resulted in stagnation with the development of new products by march 1996 the company had exhausted its line of credit reducing cash by 3 2 million on revenues of 12 7 million in the quarter in july 1996 telebit was acquired by cisco systems for 200 million primarily for their channelized t1 telebit management convinced cisco to spin off the company including all existing product families as well as a paid up license for the use of mica in future products developed by the spinoff to one of the existing management team james d norrod to become telebit incorporated and based in chelmsford in august 1997 telebit merged with itk telekommunikation based in dortmund germany the combined company was purchased a year later in july 1998 by digi international makers of the digiboard multi port serial card for pcs digi was primarily interested in telebit s isdn product family and eventually other product inventory was liquidated in march 1999 legacy while the trailblazers have generally been displaced by modems implementing the higher rate v 34 v 90 series standards and although they have been

in both the itu asymmetric digital subscriber line adsl and ieee 802 11 wireless lan standards in particular these protocols reuse pep s concept of carrying a single data link over many lower rate

first by uucp then by other means models in the roman catholic church a transitional deacon is a celibate man who has been ordained a deacon and who intends to become a priest transitional deacons are usually ordained to the diaconate after they complete their third year at the theological seminary for several centuries all roman catholic deacons were in this transitional stage between layman and priest the role of permanent deacon usually a married man who is unable to remarry after ordination if his wife predeceases him was revived after the second vatican council in the 1960s in the old catholic churches whose formal existence stems from the first vatican council in 1870 a transitional deacon may generally be celibate engaged in a relationship or married in many groups within the old catholic church only men could be ordained deacon women would not be a deacon but in fact a female deaconess which is still laity and not related to the office of priesthood liturgically the role of deacon is the same as the roman church in the anglican tradition such as the episcopal church in the united states of america a transitional deacon is similar except that in keeping with the differences in the requirements for priesthood from the roman catholic church they may be a man or woman and may be married another historical difference is that an anglican transitional deacon had to first be a graduate of an approved seminary theological college or distance education program today however many dioceses of the episcopal church in the united states of america are changing that and allowing ordination of transitional deacons during the final year of seminary the episcopal church also ordains individuals as vocational deacons see anglican ministry dovetail may refer to the

within the district agui higashiura mihama minamichita taketoyo history chita district was one of the ancient districts of owari province and is mentioned in nara period records modern chita district dates to the cadastral reforms of the early meiji period and was initially given to nukata prefecture in former mikawa province whereas the holdings of former owari domain became nagoya prefecture with the creation of aichi prefecture chita district again came to be considered part of former owari province with the organization of municipalities on october 1 1889 chita district was divided into four towns handa kamezaki yokosuka ono and 63 villages in december 1890 narawa and tokoname were also elevated arimatsu in september 1892 and utsumi in november 1893 otaka and morozaki became towns in september 1894 followed by kywa and otaka in may 1903 and toyohama in february 1905 the number of remaining villages was consolidated from 52 to 14 in 1906 leaving the district with 14 towns and 14 villages nishiura became a town in december 1911 followed by obu in november 1915 and yawata in march 1922 handa was proclaimed a city on october 1 1937 merging with the towns of kamezaki and narawa

ryzhkov russian nikolaj ivanovi rykov born 28 september 1929 is a former soviet official who became a russian politician following the dissolution of the soviet union he served as the last chairman of the council of ministers the post was abolished and replaced by that of prime minister in 1991 responsible for the cultural and economic administration of the soviet union during the late gorbachev era ryzhkov was succeeded as premier by valentin pavlov in 1991 the same year he lost his seat on the presidential council going on to become boris yeltsin s leading opponent in the russian soviet federative socialist republic rsfsr 1991 presidential election ryzhkov was born in the city of dzerzhynsk ukrainian soviet socialist republic in 1929 after graduating in the 1950s he started work in the 1970s and began his political career in local industry working his way up through the hierarchy of soviet industrial ministries in 1979 committee following nikolai tikhonov s resignation as chairman of the council of ministers ryzhkov was voted into office in his place during his tenure he supported mikhail gorbachev s 1980s reform of the soviet economy elected to the state duma of the russian federation in december 1995 as an independent ryzhkov subsequently led the power to the people block later becoming the formal leader of the people s patriotic union of russia alongside gennady ziuganov who was an unofficial leader on 17 september 2003 he resigned his seat in the duma and became a member of the federation council early life and career ryzhkov was born on 28 september 1929 in dzerzhynsk ukrainian soviet socialist republic soviet union he graduated from the ural polytechnic institute in 1959 a technocrat he started work as a welder then rose through the ranks at the sverdlovsk uralmash plant to become chief engineer then between 1970 amp ndash 1975 factory director of the uralmash production amalgamation ryzhkov joined the communist party of the soviet union moscow in 1975 and appointed to the post of first deputy minister of the ministry of heavy and transport machine building ryzhkov became first deputy chairman of the state planning committee in 1979 and was elected to the cpsu central committee in 1981 he was one of several members of the soviet leadership affiliated to the andrei kirilenko faction yuri andropov appointed ryzhkov head of the economic department of the central committee where he was responsible for overseeing major planning and financial organs excluding industry as head of the department he reported directly to mikhail gorbachev when gorbachev came to power nikolai tikhonov the chairman of the council of ministers was elected chairman of the newly established commission on improvements to the management system his title of chairman was largely honorary with ryzhkov the de facto head through his position as deputy chairman the 30 km radius was a purely random guess and it was later shown that several areas contaminated with radioactive material were left untouched by government evacuation agencies in the aftermath of ryzhkov promised to rebuild the city of spitak within two years a politburo commission was established to provide guidance for the local assr government with ryzhkov elected its chairman the commission then travelled to the assr to assess damage caused by the earthquake during gorbachev s subsequent visit to the assr and aware of local feelings following the disaster ryzhkov persuaded the less sensitive gorbachev to forgo use of his limousine in favor of public transport when gorbachev left the assr ryzhkov remained to coordinate the rescue operation and made several television appearances which increased his standing amongst the soviet leadership and the people in general with his standing thus boosted on 19 july 1988 at the central committee plenum ryzhkov criticised nearly every one of gorbachev s policies further complaining that as party secretary he should devote more time to the party in the end ryzhkov failed in his promise to rebuild spitak partly due to the soviet union s mounting economic problems and partly because many of the city s soviet era buildings their reconstruction more difficult economic policy historian jerry f hough notes that gorbachev treated ryzhkov and his reform attempts just as badly as leonid brezhnev treated alexei kosygin one time chairman of the council of ministers during the brezhnev era brezhnev s most notable snub was over the 1965 soviet economic reform ryzhkov was an early supporter of the gorbachev policy calling for an increase in the quantity and quality of goods planned for production during the period of the twelfth five year plan 1986 amp ndash 1990 to achieve these goals the government pumped money into the machine building sector but as time went by gorbachev increasingly diverged from his original stance he now wanted to increase overall investment in nearly all industrial sectors a move which ryzhkov knew was a budgetary impossibility however ryzhkov s economic policies were not much better as he continued to advocate an unreasonable increase in the production of consumer goods gorbachev and ligachev s anti alcohol campaign was opposed by ryzhkov who agreed with the state planning committee and the ministry state billions of rubles in income nevertheless the campaign went ahead losing the soviet government millions in revenues ryzhkov s opposition to the campaign was strengthened by his belief that both gorbachev and ligachev placed ideology before practical considerations and he instead advocated an alternative long term program rather than one designed to have immediate effect ryzhkov and gorbachev continued their work on economic reform and in 1987 began drafting the law on the state enterprise which restricted the authority of central planners this would later come into effect and give workers an unrealistically high level of power nikolai talyzin chairman of the state planning committee became the scapegoat for the failure of this reform and on the orders of ryzhkov he was replaced by yuri maslyukov while supporting the transition away from a planned economy ryzhkov understood that privatisation would weaken the government s power as changes occurred skepticism over perestroika and privatisation was not limited to high level government officialdom several middle and low ranking officials who owed their rise in existing system gorbachev also blamed ryzhkov and the council of ministers for the economic difficulties which arose during perestroika a move which fostered resentment for both gorbachev and perestroika nevertheless in 1986 ryzhkov stated that he along with the rest of the soviet leadership were already discussing the possibility of creating a market economy in the soviet union ryzhkov supported the creation of a regulated market economy where the government sector occupied the commanding heights of the economy as well as the creation of semi private public companies his second cabinet several high standing members of the kgb and the military establishment all supported ryzhkov s opposition to the 500 days programme which espoused a quick transition to a market economy matters did not improve when at the second session of the congress of people s deputies of the soviet union ryzhkov proposed postponing the transition to a market economy until 1992 further suggesting that in the period between 1990 amp ndash 1992 recentralisation of government activities would ensure a period of of leonid abalkin s and one created by himself in conjunction with the maslyukov chaired state planning committee along with several other government institutions with strong support from ryzhkov gorbachev abolished the central committee economic department thereby strengthening the authority of central government over economic matters from then on the government could not be blamed for economic policies initiated by the party leadership the establishment of the post of president of the soviet union by gorbachev in 1990 weakened the power of the government apparatus a move ryzhkov and ryzhkov s second government price reform according to swedish economist anders slund ryzhkov differed little from gorbachev when it came to price reform by 1988 ryzhkov increasingly sided with leonid abalkin one of the few economists who advocated fiscal responsibility at the 19th conference of the central committee abalkin was severely criticised by gorbachev and accused of economic determinism several conference delegates agreed with gorbachev but ryzhkov s support remained solid abalkin was ordered to deliver a report to the presidium of the council put financial stability at the top of its agenda gorbachev disliked abalkin s report and rejected ryzhkov s requests that he support it ryzhkov was then forced to create an even more conservative reform plan for 1989 in which price reform was to be postponed until 1991 when the abalkin report was proposed at the central committee plenum the majority of delegates indirectly attacked gorbachev for his indecisiveness when it came to the implementation of price reform in april 1990 after submitting a draft to the presidential council and the federation council ryzhkov s price reform was initiated however a short while later it was once more put on hold following severe criticism from boris yeltsin and several pro gorbachev intellectuals the economic turmoil which hit the soviet union in 1990 was blamed on ryzhkov even though it was gorbachev who had delayed ryzhkov s proposed reform in his memoirs gorbachev vaguely asserts that a single price increase would be better than several fall from power in august 1990 several leading officials tried to persuade gorbachev did not bow to this pressure fearing that ryzhkov s removal would lead to increased activity by many of his pro republican first secretaries and politburo members ryzhkov s numerous supporters were not concerned about policy issues they backed him simply because he opposed some of gorbachev s economic and political reforms ryzhkov s plan and the 500 days programme were broadly similar with both supporting price liberalisation decentralisation and privatisation in december 1990 ryzhkov suffered a heart attack during his recovery the supreme soviet of the soviet union dissolved the council of ministers and replaced it with the cabinet of ministers soviet union rsfsr politics and post soviet russia after recovering from his heart attack in early 1991 ryzhkov stood as the communist candidate in the first election of the president of the russian soviet federative socialist republic rsfsr at the election on 12 june 1991 he gained 13 395 335 votes equal to 16 9 of the electorate boris yeltsin beat him decisively with 57 ryzhkov s vice presidential candidate was boris military during the final stages of the war in afghanistan most of ryzhkov s votes came from the countryside while he had hoped to win over voters who were becoming increasingly disenfranchised as a result of perestroika and gorbachev s leadership even though the latter supported his candidacy during the russian legislative election 1995 in 1996 ryzhkov was one of the founders of the cprf led alliance of leftists and nationalists known as the people s patriotic union of russia ppur and was elected chairman of its duma faction the ppur s formal leaders were ryzhkov and ziuganov who was an unofficial leader in september 2003 ryzhkov entered the federation council of the

special contributions in a particular field area or the community in general the date on which teachers day is celebrated varies from country to country teachers days are distinct from world teachers day which is officially celebrated across the world on october 5 history the idea of celebrating teachers day took ground independently in many countries during the 20th century in most cases they celebrate a local educator or an important milestone in education for example argentina commemorates domingo faustino sarmiento s death on september 11 since 1915 while india celebrates dr sarvepalli radhakrishnan s birthday on september 5 since 1962 this is the primary reason why countries celebrate this day on different dates unlike many other international days by country class wikitable country date of teachers day notes the government never clearly explained why it should fall on september 10 some people believe it was an arbitrary choice and have proposed to change it to september 28 which is believed to be confucius s birthday on sep 5 2013 the state council announced a legislative draft endorsing the change if adopted it would effectively make mainland china and taiwan share the same teachers day beginning in 2014 taiwan has observed september 28 as teachers day since the 1950s another day set aside for commemorating teachers in india and nepal is guru purnima also called ashad sukla purnima it typically falls in mid july the first teachers day was celebrated on may 15 1918 the date of may 15 was proposed at the mexican congress on september 27 1917 approved on october 29 1917 and published on december 5 1917 there are several possible origins for choosing this date the first one mentions that in the city of san luis potos every may 15 a group of isidore this teacher was named after saint isidore the laborer following the mexican tradition of naming children according the saint celebrated the day they were born the second origin considers the celebration of a historic event in the city of quertaro on may 15 1867 students pay homage to the teachers offer them foods and flowers and receive blessings from the teacher gurudevo bhava a sanskrit phrase meaning be a person for whom the teacher is god is still widely accepted teachers are given the highest degree of respect many years later on 1953 the then president manuel a odra decided that teachers day would be commemorated on the 6th of july in 1952 the executive yuan changed it to september stating that it was calculated to be the precise date in the gregorian calendar the festival celebration occurs in the temples of confucius around the island known as the grand ceremony dedicated to confucius the ceremony begins at 6am with drum beats 54 musicians are dressed in robes with dressed in yellow with green belts they are led by confucius s chief descendant currently kung tsui chang and followed by ceremonial officers three animalsthe cow the goat and the pigare sacrificed the hairs plucked from these sacrificed animals are called the hairs of wisdom in addition local education institutes and civil offices award certain teachers for their excellence and positive influence the nea gives a history of national teacher day the origins of teacher day are murky around 1944 wisconsin teacher ryan krug began corresponding with political and education leaders about the need for a national day to honor teachers woodbridge wrote to eleanor roosevelt who in 1953 persuaded the 81st congress to proclaim a national teacher day nea along with its kansas and indiana

persia today s iran from 16 july 1909 to 31 october 1925 and the last ruling member of the qajar dynasty reign ahmad shah ascended to the sun throne on 16 july 1909 following the overthrow of his father and predecessor mohammad ali shah who had attempted to reverse earlier constitutional restrictions on royal power and thus enraged the majority of persians it is alleged that ahmad shah was one of the most selfish kings of persia while others regard him as a strong ruler interested in attending to the matters of government after removing muhammad ali shah from power the grand majles placed ahmad shah on the throne the grand majles consisted of 500 delegate members who came from different backgrounds they held a special tribunal in order to punish all those who participated in the civil war among those hanged was sheikh fazlollah noori ahmad by appointing the best ministers he could find he was however an ineffective ruler who was faced with internal unrest and foreign intrusions particularly by the british empire the second majles convened on november 1910 and just like the first majlis did not lead to any relevant accomplishment the majles was rendered ineffective because the central government was weak and did not have enough influence to reign in the changes that it had proposed it is alleged that the second majles did not get along with ahmad shah in 1917 britain used persia as the springboard for an attack into russia in an unsuccessful attempt to reverse the russian revolution of 1917 the newly born soviet union responded by annexing portions of northern persia as buffer states much like its tsarist predecessor marching on tehran the soviets extracted ever more humiliating concessions from the qajar government whose ministers ahmad shah was often unable to control the weakness of the central bureaucracy in the face of such aggression by an atheist foreign power sparked seething anger among many traditional condemn both communism and monarchy as treason against persia s sovereignty and the laws of islam by 1920 the government had virtually lost all power outside its capital and ahmad shah had lost control of the situation the anglo persian agreement along with new political parties furthermore immobilized the country the moderates and democrats often clashed particularly when it came to minority rights and secularism the debates between the two political parties led to violence and even assassinations the weak economic state of persia put ahmad shah and his government at the mercy of foreign influence they had to obtain loans from the imperial bank of persia furthermore under the agreement only a small fraction of the income generated by the anglo persian oil company was received by persia on the other hand the red army along with rebels and warlords ruled much of the countryside on 21 february 1921 ahmad shah was pushed aside in a military coup by his minister of war and commander of the cossack garrison colonel reza khan who coup reza khan used three thousand men and only eighteen machine guns a very bloodless coup that moved forward quickly reza khan was a self made man who climbed his way up through the military ranks and appeared to be the right man to take back control of persia one of his first actions was to rescind the anglo persian treaty and this was seen as a very successful diplomatic move since the treaty was very unpopular in addition he signed the russo persian treaty of friendship this agreement canceled all previous treaties between the two countries and also gave persia full and equal shipping right in the caspian sea stripped of all his remaining powers ahmad shah went into exile with his family in 1923 ahmad shah s apparent lack of interest in attending to the affairs of the state and poor health had prompted him to leave persia on this extended european tour he was formally deposed on 31 october 1925 when reza khan was proclaimed shah by the founders assembly taking the title reza shah pahlavi and established the pahlavi dynasty exile the coup of 1921 rendered ahmad shah politically weaker and less relevant in 1923 ahmad shah left persia for europe for health reasons later the formal termination of the qajar dynasty by the majles turned ahmad shah s 1923 european tour into exile from exile ahmad shah issued the following declaration indicating his displeasure with the turn of events that had led to his overthrow shortly after the coup mustafa kemal ataturk who had just taken power in turkey as its first president offered to help restore ahmad shah to the throne to that end he summoned persian ambassador to turkey anoushirvan sepahbody to the presidential palace and instructed him to immediately intervene on his behalf with soltan ahmad shah in paris with the following offer of assistance ahmad shah politely declined this offer possibly either due to pride or lack of interest in continuing as king allegedly it was only after this rejection of ataturk s offer that the turkish government threw its full recognizing him as the new sovereign of persia prior to his death it is said that ahmad shah followed frequent crash diets which did not help his health for example he lost and gained 90 kg within a two year span he died in 1930 at neuilly sur seine outside paris france and was buried in his family crypt in kerbela iraq his brother former crown prince mohammad hassan mirza assured the physical continuation of the dynasty through his descendants offspring ahmad shah qajar married five times his first wife was lida jahanbani he did also have 4

pennsylvania deathplace los angeles california harry kellar july 11 1849 amp ndash march 10 1922 was an american magician who presented large stage shows during the late 19th and early 20th centuries kellar was a predecessor of harry houdini and a successor of robert heller he was often referred to as the dean of american magicians and performed extensively on five continents one of his most memorable stage illusions was the levitation of a girl advertised as the levitation of princess karnack which was similar to an illusion invented by john nevil maskelyne from which kellar copied by bribing one of maskelyne s theater staff he was a longtime customer of the martinka magic company which built many of his illusions and sets including the blue room early life like most magicians there is little of kellar s early life that can be confirmed his real name was heinrich keller and he was born to german immigrants in erie pennsylvania he was sometimes as a child kellar loved to play dangerous games and was known to play chicken with passing trains kellar apprenticed under a druggist and frequently experimented with various chemical mixtures on one occasion kellar reportedly blew a hole in the floor of his employer s drugstore rather than confront the wrath of his parents kellar stowed away on a train and became a vagabond he was only ten years old at the time kellar was befriended by a british born minister of religion from upstate new york he offered to adopt kellar and pay for his education if he would study to also become a minister one evening kellar saw the performance of a traveling magician the fakir of ava the stage name of isiaiah harris hughes and after the show kellar immediately got the urge to go on the stage he later told houdini that i became very restless bought books on magic and finally left my friend and benefactor while working on a farm in buffalo new york kellar hughes who was looking for an assistant kellar was hired and at the age of sixteen gave his first solo performance in dunkirk michigan it was a disaster and kellar went back to work with hughes two years later keller tried again with better results but as he was in poor financial condition his early career often consisted of borrowing equipment for the show and avoiding creditors career in 1869 kellar began working with the davenport brothers and fay which was a group of stage spirtualists made up of ira erastus davenport william henry davenport and william fay kellar spent several years working with them until 1873 when he and fay parted ways with the davenports and embarked on a world tour through central and south america in mexico they were able to make 10 000 0 in today s figures in 1875 the tour ended in rio de janeiro with an appearance before emperor dom pedro ii then on their way to were sailing on the boyne sank in the bay of biscay lost in the wreckage were keller s equipment and clothing along with the ship s cargo of gold silver and uncut diamonds after the shipwreck keller was left with only the clothes on his back and a diamond ring he was wearing afterwards his bankers in new york cabled him telling him that his bank had failed desperate for money kellar sold his ring and parted ways with fay who left to rejoin the davenports after visiting john nevil maskelyne s and george alfred cooke s theater called the egyptian hall keller was inspired and liked the idea of performing in one spot he loved the illusions maskelyne and cook performed but it was buatier de kolta then playing there who performed the vanishing birdcage a trick that kellar decided he must have and spent his remaining money to buy it from him kellar borrowed 500 from junius spencer morgan father of j p to try to retrieve his funds from a bank transaction he had initiated when he was in brazil knowing that mail from brazil was slow he was able to recover all of the 3 500 with the money kellar started a troupe based on masekylne s and cooke s in england even going so far as naming his theater the egyptian hall in 1878 kellar returned to england and invested 12 000 into purchasing new equipment including a version maskelyne s whist playing automaton psycho after a disappointing tour in south america kellar cancelled his remaining shows and returned to new york shortly before arriving kellar was told of the death of magician robert heller the new york sun accused kellar of pirating heller s name saying that heller is scarcely dead before we read of kellar the wizard the article goes on to say of course kellar aims to profit by the reputation that heller left by adopting a close imitation of heller s name this is his name had always been keller with an e and that he had actually changed it years previously to try to avoid being confused with heller he also pointed out that heller had changed his name from william henry palmer the public was still unreceptive to him causing kellar to eventually cancel his upcoming shows in the united states and return to brazil after another world tour in 1882 kellar was performing again in melbourne australia and met a fan eva lydia medley who came backstage to get his autograph kellar promised to send postcards and letters from his travels they exchanged letters for the next five years kellar started his version of egyptian hall in december 1884 after renting out an old masonic temple on chestnut street in philadelphia pennsylvania after 264 performances kellar closed the theater on june 24 1885 shortly after kellar left the theater burned down while kellar was performing in america medley arrived a few weeks before his appearance in erie pennsylvania she played the magic business kellar and medley were married on november 1 1887 at a church in kalamazoo michigan she played an important role in kellar s shows in the coming years not only did she play a part in many of his upcoming illusions but she also provided music for the shows kellar returned to philadelphia in october 1891 and opened his second egyptian hall at concert hall located also on chestnut street on april 30 1892 kellar ended a successful seven month run at his second egyptian hall kellar then returned to the road during the periods kellar was abroad another magician alexander herrmann had become famous and kellar found himself with a rival on his return to the united states herrmann often criticized kellar s lack of sleight of hand and claimed he preferred to use mechanical tricks instead while he lacked sleight of hand kellar was so good in using misdirection that he said a brass band playing at full blast can march openly across the stage behind no one will realize that they went by herrmann died on december 17 1896 later life kellar retired in 1908 and allowed howard thurston to be his successor kellar had met thurston who was doing card tricks while on vacation in paris france kellar did his final show at ford s theatre in baltimore maryland kellar eventually moved to his house in los angeles california kellar s wife died two years later kellar was often visited by other magicians notably including harry houdini on november 11 1917 houdini put together a show for the society of american magicians to benefit the families of those who died in the sinking of the uss antilles by a german u boat who have been considered the first american casualties of world war i houdini got kellar to come out of retirement to perform one more show the show took place on the largest stage at the time the hippodrome after kellar s performance kellar started americas greatest magician should be carried off in triumph after his final public performance the members of the society of american magicians helped kellar into the seat of a sedan chair and lifted it up the 125 piece hippodrome orchestra played auld lang syne while kellar was slowly taken away kellar lived in retirement until he died on march 3 1922 from a pulmonary hemorrhage brought on by influenza he was interred in angelus rosedale cemetery in los angeles notable illusions the levitation of princess karnac kellar supposedly developed this trick by abruptly walking onto the stage during a show by maskelyne seeing what he needed to know and leaving unable to duplicate it kellar hired another magician to help build another but eventually designed a new trick with the help of the otis elevator company another version built by kellar was purchased by harry blackstone sr who used the trick for many years the buffalo writer john northern hilliard wrote that the levitation was a marvel of the twentieth century and career the nested boxes kellar borrows six finger rings from members of audience he loads them into the barrel of a pistol aims and fires the pistol at a chest that is hanging on the side of the stage the chest is opened and inside is another smaller chest inside that are six boxes nested in each other as each is opened they are stacked on top of each other and inside the smallest one are the five rings each tied with ribbon to flowers the five rings are returned to their owners the owner of the sixth ring wonders what happened to hers with kellar pretending not to notice he continues with his next trick which a variation of robert houdin s inexhaustible bottle audience members call out different beverages like wine whiskey lemonade or just water each one is poured from the same bottle and the audience acknowledges that they are indeed receiving their requested drinks once bottle is empty kellar takes it and breaks it open its neck which has the sixth ring attached to it the ring is eventually handed back to its owner a variation of the trick was performed in front of united states president theodore roosevelt and his children ethel archie quentin and kermit ethel was the owner of the sixth ring and after kellar had returned her ring he asked if she would also like to have the guinea pig as a pet then kellar wrapped the guinea pig in paper and handed it back to ethel when it was opened inside was a bouquet of pink roses the vanishing lamp a lamp is seen set on top of a glass table still lit kellar covers the lamp with a thin cloth kellar told the audience that each evening the lamp would be returned to its purported original owner in india at a specific time as a bell sounded out the current time of day kellar loaded a pistol and aimed it towards the lamp at the last chime kellar with the cloth falling to the stage kellar was known to have a short temper and once after an incident in which the vanishing lamp failed to vanish he took an axe to the defective prop later kellar built another one that would continue to work reliably long after his retirement footnotes height zvezda meaning star dos 8 also known as the zvezda service module is a component of the international space station iss it was the third module launched to the station and provides all of the station s life support systems some of which are supplemented in the usos as well as living quarters for two crew members it is the structural and functional center of the russian portion of the station the russian orbital segment the module was manufactured by rkk energia with major sub contracting work by gknpts khrunichev zvezda was launched on a proton rocket on july 12 2000 and docked with the zarya module on july 26 the rocket used for the launch was one of the first to carry advertising it was emblazoned with the logo of pizza hut restaurants for which they are reported to have paid more than us 1 million the money helped support advertising agencies that orchestrated the event origins the basic structural frame of zvezda known as dos 8 was initially built in the mid 1980s to be the core of the mir 2 space station this means that zvezda is similar in layout to the core module dos 7 of the mir space station it was in fact labeled as mir 2 for quite some time in the factory its design lineage thus extends back to the original salyut stations the space frame was completed in february 1985 and major internal equipment was installed by october 1986 the mir 2 space station was redesigned after the failure of the polyus orbital weapons platform core module to reach orbit zvezda is around 1 4 the size of polyus and has no armaments design zvezda consists of a cylindrical work compartment where the crews work and live a cylindrical transfer chamber which has one docking port an unpressurized assembly compartment surrounding three docking ports four docking ports total the component weighs about 18051kg lb and had a length of 13 1 m the solar panels extend 29 7 m the transfer compartment attaches to the zarya module and has docking ports intended for the science power platform and the universal docking module as in the early days of mir the transfer compartment provides a suitable eva airlock where spacewalkers in orlan suits removed a hatch after closing a few that connected the compartment to the rest of the station it was used only during expedition 2 where two men put a docking cone on the nadir port the lower port connects to pirs and the top port connects to poisk eventually the plan for pirs is for it to be deorbited and replaced by the multipurpose laboratory module the assembly compartment holds external equipment such as thrusters thermometers antennas and propellant tanks the transfer chamber is equipped with automatic docking zvezda can support up to six crew including separate sleeping quarters for two cosmonauts at a time it also has a nasa provided treadmill with vibration isolation system and a bicycle for exercise a toilet and other hygiene facilities and a galley with a refrigerator and freezer the module contains the primary russian computers for guidance and navigation zvezda has 14 windows there are two 9inmm adj mid windows one in each of the two crew sleep compartments windows no 1 and 2 six 9inmm adj mid windows no 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 on the forward transfer compartment earth facing floor as well a 16inmm adj mid window in the main working compartment no 9 and one 3inmm adj mid window in the aft transfer compartment no 10 there are a further three 9inmm adj mid windows in the forward end of the forward transfer compartment no 12 13 and 14 for observing approaching craft note window no 11 zvezda also contains the elektron system that electrolyzes condensed humidity and waste water to provide hydrogen and oxygen the hydrogen is expelled into space and the oxygen is used for breathing air the condensed water and the waste water can be used for drinking in an emergency but ordinarily fresh water from earth is used there are 16 small thrusters and two large thrusters for propulsion and eight batteries for storing power the elektron system has required significant maintenance work having failed several times and requiring the crew to use the solid fuel oxygen generator canisters also called oxygen candles which were the cause of a fire on mir when it has been broken for extended amounts of time it also contains the vozdukh a system which removes carbon dioxide from the air based on the use of regenerable absorbers of carbon dioxide gas zvezda has been criticized for being excessively noisy and the crew has been observed wearing earplugs inside it zvezda contains the esa s connection to the iss on july 26 2000 zvezda became the third component of the iss when it docked at the aft port of zarya zarya had already been attached to the u s unity module later in july the computers aboard zarya handed over iss commanding functions to computers on zvezda on september 11 2000 two members of the sts 106 space shuttle crew completed final connections between zvezda and zarya during a 6 hour 14 minute eva astronaut ed lu and cosmonaut yuri malenchenko connected nine cables between zvezda and zarya including four power cables four video and data cables and a fiber optic telemetry cable the next day sts 106 crew members floated into zvezda for the first time at 05 20 utc on september 12 2000 life support system a communication system zvezda introduced a 10 mbit s ethernet network to the iss electrical power distribution a data processing system a flight control system and a propulsion system these quarters and some but not all systems have since been supplemented by additional iss components the two main engines on zvezda can be used to raise the station s altitude this was done on april 25 2007 this was the first time the engines had been fired since zvezda arrived in 2000 launch risks due to russian financial problems zvezda was launched with no backup and no insurance due to this risk nasa had constructed an interim control module in case it was

hitherto split system of courts in england and wales the first two acts were the supreme court of judicature act 1873 36 amp 37 vict c 66 and the supreme court of judicature act 1875 38 amp 39 vict c 77 with a further series of amending acts 12 in all by 1899 by the act of 1873 ss 3 4 the court of chancery the court of queen s bench known as the king s bench when there is a male sovereign the court of common pleas the court of exchequer the high court of admiralty the court of probate and the court of divorce and matrimonial causes were consolidated into the supreme court of judicature subdivided into two courts the high court of justice high court with broadly speaking original jurisdiction and the court of appeal threefold to combine the historically separate courts of common law and equity to establish for all divisions of the new supreme court a uniform system of pleading and procedure and to provide for the enforcement of the same rule of law in those cases where equity and common law recognised different rules the enactment was bold and revolutionary by one section the queen s bench the common pleas in which only serjeants formerly had the right of audience and the exchequer and all their jurisdiction whether criminal legal or equitable were vested in the new court the fusion of the systems of law and equity was not complete however as the chancery equity division retained a distinct existence within the new court from the queen s bench common law division having a certain range of legal questions under its exclusive control and possessing to a certain extent a peculiar machinery of its own for carrying its decrees into execution nevertheless all actions could now for the and subject to such special assignments of business as mentioned could be tried in any of its divisions common law and equity the procedure of the common law courts had developed along highly technical and stylised lines for example to bring an action in the common law courts a litigant had to file a writ chosen from a set of standard forms the court would only recognise certain forms of action and this led to the widespread use of legal fictions with litigants disguising their claims when they did not fit into a standard recognised form the emphasis on rigid adherence to established forms led to substantial injustice on the other hand the court of chancery a court of equity ran separately and parallel to the common law courts and emphasised the need to do justice on the basis of the lord chancellor s conscience softening the blunt instrument of the common law however by the nineteenth century proceedings before the court of chancery often dragged on and on with cases problem that was parodied by charles dickens in the fictional case of jarndyce and jarndyce in bleak house also the practice of the court departed from the original principle of the lord chancellor s conscience with rules of equity restricting the manner in which the courts of equity would intervene the existence of these two separate systems led to each party forum shopping selecting whichever of the two systems would most likely give judgment in his or her favour and resulting in litigation being tried across both the solution adopted by the judicature acts of 1873 and 1875 was to fuse the administration of the two pleadings became more relaxed with the emphasis shifting from the form of action to the cause or a set of causes of action writs for action were filled out for a litigant stating facts without any necessity of pigeonholing them into specific forms the same court was now able to apply rules of the common law and the of a case required and depending on what specific area of law the pleadings involved the result was that when the issues arising from the causes of action were decided in favour of one party that party got relief overview there were originally three common law divisions of the high court corresponding with the three former courts of common law however after the deaths of lord chief baron kelly on 17 september 1880 and lord chief justice cockburn on 10 november 1880 the common pleas and exchequer divisions were consolidated by an order in council of 10 december 1880 with the king s bench division into a single division under the presidency of the lord chief justice of england to whom by the judicature act 1881 s 25 all the statutory jurisdiction of the chief baron and the chief justice of the common pleas was transferred the high court therefore came to consist of the chancery division the common law division known as the king and admiralty division to the king s bench division was also attached by an order of the lord chancellor dated 1 january 1884 the business of the london court of bankruptcy the keystone of the structure created by the judicature acts was a strong court of appeal the house of lords remained the last court of appeal as before the acts but its judicial functions were transferred in practice to an appellate committee consisting of the lord chancellor and other peers who have held high judicial office and certain lords of appeal in ordinary created by the appellate jurisdiction act 1876 the high court and court of appeal were formerly referred to as comprising the supreme court of judicature a concept wholly distinct from the current supreme court of the united kingdom pleading the most important matter dealt with by the rules is the mode of pleading the authors of the judicature act had before them two systems of pleading both of which were open to criticism the common law pleadings it was said relied but only the legal aspect of the facts or the inferences from them while the chancery pleadings were lengthy tedious and to a large extent irrelevant and useless there was some exaggeration in both statements in pursuing the fusion of law and equity which was the dominant legal idea of law reformers of that period the framers of the first set of rules devised a system which they thought would meet the defects of both systems and be appropriate for both the common law and the chancery divisions in a normal case the plaintiff delivered his statement of claim in which he was to set forth concisely the facts on which he relied and the relief which he asked the defendant then delivered his statement of defence in which he was to say whether he admitted or denied the plaintiff s facts every averment not traversed being taken to be admitted and any additional facts and legal defences on which he relied the plaintiff might then reply and the defendant rejoin and system of pleading was not a bad one if accompanied by the right of either party to demur to his opponent s pleading i e to say admitting all your averments of fact to be true you still have no cause of action or defence as the case may be it may be however that the authors of the new system were too intent on uniformity when they abolished the common law pleading which shorn of its abuses as it had been by the common law procedure acts was an admirable instrument for defining the issue between the parties though unsuited for the more complicated cases which are tried in chancery and it might possibly have been better to try the new system in the first instance in the chancery division only it should be added that the rules contain provisions for actions being tried without pleadings if the defendant does not require a statement of claim and for the plaintiff in an action of debt obtaining immediate judgment unless the defendant are of course no pleadings in those matters which by the rules can be disposed of by summons in chambers instead of by ordinary suit as formerly the judges seem to have been dissatisfied with the effect of their former rules for in 1883 they issued a fresh set of consolidated rules which with subsequent amendments are those now in force by these rules a further attempt was made to prune the exuberance of pleading concise forms of statement of claim and defence were given in the appendix for adoption by the pleader it is true that these forms do not display a high standard of excellence in draftsmanship and it was said that many of them were undoubtedly demurrable but that was not of much importance demurrers were abolished and instead thereof it was provided that any point of law raised by the pleadings should be disposed of at or after the trial provided that by consent or order of the court the same might be set down and disposed of before the trial order xxv opinion of lord davey in 1902 was a disastrous change the right of either party to challenge his opponent in limine either where the question between them was purely one of law or where even the view of the facts taken and alleged by his opponent did not constitute a cause of action or defence was a most valuable one and tended to the curtailment of both the delay and the expense of litigation any possibility of abuse by frivolous or technical demurrers as undoubtedly was formerly the case had been met by powers of amendment and the infliction of costs many of the most important questions of law had been decided on demurrer both in common law and chancery lord davey considered that demurrer was a useful and satisfactory mode of trying questions in chancery on bill and demurrer and it was frequently adopted in preference to a special case which requires the statement of facts to be agreed to by both parties and was consequently more difficult and expensive time for decision of questions at law the trial or subsequently and a preliminary decision the exception and such exception dependent on the consent of both parties or an order of the court is a poor substitute for a demurrer as of right and it has proved so in practice the editors of the yearly practice for 1901 muir mackenzie lushington and fox said p 272 points of law raised by the pleadings are usually disposed of at the trial or on further considerationafterthe trial of the issues of fact that is to say after the delay worry and expense of a trial of disputed questions of fact which after all may turn out to be unnecessary the abolition of demurrers has also it is believed had a prejudicial effect on the standard of legal accuracy and knowledge required in practitioners formerly the pleader had the fear of a demurrer before him nowadays he need not stop to think whether his cause of action or defence will obviously frivolous or vexatious will do by way of pleading for the purpose of the trial and for getting the opposite party into the box juries another change was made by the rules of 1883 which was regarded by some common law lawyers as revolutionary formerly every issue of fact in a common law action including the amount of damage had to be decided by the verdict of a jury the effect of the rules of 1883 said lord lindley who was a member of the rule committee was to make trial without a jury the normal mode of trial except where trial with a jury is ordered under rules 6 or 7a or may be had without an order under rule 2 the effect of the rules may be thus summarised in the chancery division no trial by jury unless ordered by the judge generally the judge may order trial without a jury of any cause or issue which before the judicature act might have been so tried without consent of parties or scientific or local investigation either party has a right to a jury in actions of slander libel false imprisonment malicious prosecution seduction or breach of promise of marriage upon notice without order or in any other action by order subject as above actions are to be tried without a jury unless the judge of his own motion otherwise orders abandonment among the specific changes to procedure that occurred as a result of enactment of the judicature acts was one impacting on the matter of abandonment of an action such an abandonment involves the discontinuance of proceedings commenced in the high court typically emerging because a plaintiff is convinced that he will not succeed in a civil action prior to the 1875 act considerable latitude was allowed as to the time when a suitor might abandon his action and yet preserve his right to bring another action on the same suit see nonsuit but since 1875 this right has been considerably curtailed and a plaintiff who has wishes to abandon his action can generally obtain leave so to do only on condition of bringing no further proceedings in the matter other changes further steps have been taken with a view to simplification of procedure by order xxx rule i as amended in 1897 a summons called a summons for directions has to be taken out by a plaintiff immediately after the appearance of the defendant and upon such summons an order is to be made respecting pleadings and a number of interlocutory proceedings to make such an order at that early stage would seem to demand a prescience and intelligent anticipation of future events which can hardly be expected of a master or even a judge in chambers except in simple cases involving a single issue of law or fact which the parties are agreed in presenting to the court the effect of the rule is that the plaintiff can not deliver his statement of claim or take any step in the action without the leave of the judge the plaintiff deliver his statement of claim and the rest of the summons stand over and the practical effect is merely to add a few pounds to the costs it may be doubted whether as applied to the majority of actions the rule does not proceed on wrong lines and whether it would not be better to leave the parties who know the exigencies of their case better even than a judge in chambers to proceed in their own way subject to stringent provisions for immediate payment of the costs occasioned by unnecessary vexatious or dilatory proceedings the order does not apply to admiralty cases or to proceedings under the order next mentioned the supreme court of judicature act ireland 1877 followed the same lines as the english acts the pre existing courts were consolidated into a supreme court of judicature consisting of a high court of justice and a court of appeal the judicature acts did not affect the scottish judicial system but the appellate jurisdiction act included the court of to the house of lords farmhouse is the eighth official studio

billion dollar babies started out in the hope that alice would return and battle axe would be the new record from the alice cooper group as history will show that was n t the outcome everyone decided to proceed without alice time magazine featured the group in a brief but hopeful write up in 1977 there had been a fantastic and very theatrical stage show planned in which bruce and marconi would battle each other in the fashion of gladiators in spite of the positive start the band was embroiled the tour was quite brief as well the very imaginative stage show was far too costly as it would turn out their only release was 1977 s battle axe unfortunately the battle axe record lost any momentum it had when it was recalled for mastering problems which caused the turntable needle to skip bruce dunaway and smith had also invested a large sum of their own money in the project jack douglas who had worked on muscle of love with jack richardson was hired to fix the mastering problem with

on colposcopic examination in uk it is known as large loop excision of the transformation zone lletz the procedure has many advantages including low cost high success rate and ease of use the procedure can be done in an office setting and usually only requires a local anesthetic though sometimes iv sedation or a general anesthetic is used process when performing a leep the physician uses a wire loop through which an electric current is passed at variable power settings various shapes and sizes of loop can be used depending on the size and orientation of the lesion the cervical transformation zone and lesion are excised to an adequate depth which in most cases is at least 8 mm and extending 4 to 5 mm beyond the lesion a second pass with a more narrow loop can also be done to obtain technique results in some thermal artifact in all specimens obtained due to the use of electricity which simultaneously cuts and cauterizes the lesion but this does not generally interfere with pathological interpretation complications complications are less frequent in comparison to a cold knife conization but can include infection and hemorrhage a study with surveys to women has indicated that the leep does not appear to affect fertility on the other hand a case control study has found an association between surgical treatment of cin lesions and risk of infertility or subfertility with an odds ratio of approximately 2 scarring of the cervix is a theoretical mechanism of causing trouble conceiving this scar tissue can be massaged or broken up in a number of ways thus allowing the cervical opening to dilate back to normal size a cohort study came to the result that women with a time interval from leep to pregnancy of less than 12 months compared with 12 months or more were at significantly increased risk for spontaneous abortion with risk of spontaneous abortion of 18 no increased risk was identified for preterm birth after leep the nissan micra known in latin america and

market cherry was renamed march the bodystyle was originally designed for fiat as a replacement for the fiat 127 but fiat then adopted the giugiaro styled uno instead it was introduced in the european market in 1983 and in canada in 1984 for the 1985 model year replacing the slightly larger nissan pulsar hatchbacks because the micra was launched during nissan s rebranding effort to systematically phase out the datsun name a small appeared on the tailgate for the first two years and in some european markets the car was known as the datsun nissan micra the datsun badges had disappeared completely by the end of 1984 the micra was initially available with an extremely refined all aluminium ma10s sohc engine developing 50ps or 55ps in the high compression version it was also available

eleventh most popular new car in the uk with just under 50 000 sales it was a popular choice with driving instructors and undemanding motorists thanks to its ease of driving solid build and durable mechanical components 343 411 were sold in nearly a decade as recently as early 2007 almost 15 years after the last examples were sold 96 421 examples were still reported to be in circulation and four years on as the 20th anniversary of its demise approaches the number remaining on britain s roads is likely to be still well into five figures it compares particularly well to many other popular small

final year or two of its predecessor s life although it has never featured in the smmt s official top 10 best selling cars in the uk it has been among the best selling 10 cars in britain among private buyers for virtually all of its production life in 2003 the bbc s top gear programme featured a segment on cars that gave value for money highlighting specification that could be purchased for 9 000 the micra k12 was selected and tested by presenter richard hammond who gave it a positive review this was despite comparing its qualities to those of a boeing 737 concluding that the micra had all the toys however when hammond tested the micra c c in 2006 he was less than enthusiastic this was because his model was coloured pink and driving it with a paper bag over his head the pink c c was one of only five made specifically for nissan s sponsorship of the c c tlc tour in 200506 in support of the breakthrough breast cancer charity such was the public s response that nissan subsequently announced the launch of the micra c c pink limited to 100 models these quickly sold out and another production run was announced in august 2006 this time limited to 175 cars in july 2004 nissan

popular choice for the k11 and dangerous car in the event of a crash for the models produced between 1988 and 1995 however safety specification has improved with successive models the micra s euro ncap ratings are two stars for the k11 and four for the k12 the k12 micra came top of its class in what car magazine s security supertest in 2003 passing both entry and driveaway tests and achieving a maximum score for its locking system and immobiliser in 2005 the uk motor insurance research expert introduced a standard for keyless go requiring the device to be inoperable at a distance of more

come from austrian occupied serbia to prepare a more suitable criminal and civil code of laws for serbia they were vasilije lazarevi brgermeister or mayor of zemun and jovan hadi lawyer poet and member of the municipal senate of novi sad in january he advised a great national assembly that he had obtained an imperial edict from the sultan ending all direct obligations of serbian peasants to their former turkish lords guaranteeing ottoman recognition of serbian autonomy in most matters of internal administration and offering serbia the prospect of territorial aggrandizement as well as the express right to institute schools courts and a governmental administration of her own sultan s decrees of 1830 and 1833 expanded the same rights to a larger territory and made serbia a sovereign principality with milo obrenovi as hereditary prince a metropolitanate of serbia was established in belgrade and made autonomous part of guarantor of serbia s autonomy was also recognized later rule the people of serbia often rebelled against milo s autocratic and often brutal rule following one such rebellion he agreed to adopt a constitution in 1835 the move was opposed by neighboring austria the ruling ottoman empire and russia it is believed that the three great empires saw the constitution as a danger to their own autocratic systems of government metternich s austria particularly ridiculed the fact that serbia had its own flag and ministry of foreign affairs milo abolished the constitution at the demand of russia and turkey milo abdicated in 1839 in favor of his sons milan who died a few weeks later and mihailo who then became prince mihailo was deposed in 1842 and the family was out of power until 1858 when it returned with milo restored as prince for the last two years of his life cowhill is a small village south of oldbury south gloucestershire england its most prominent feature is the church known as cowhill church st arilda the armistice between the allies and germany known as the armistice of compigne after the location it was signed was the agreement that ended the fighting in western europe that comprised the first world war it went into effect at 11 a m paris time on 11 november 1918 and marked a victory for the allies and a complete defeat for germany although not technically a surrender the germans were responding to the policies proposed by american president woodrow wilson in his fourteen points of january 1918 the actual terms largely written by french marshal ferdinand foch included the cessation of hostilities the withdrawal of german troops to behind their own borders the preservation of infrastructure the exchange of prisoners a promise of reparations the disposition of german warships and submarines and conditions for prolonging or terminating the armistice although the armistice ended the actual fighting it took six months of negotiations at the paris peace conference to conclude the peace treaty the treaty of versailles october 1918 telegrams the liberal prince maximilian of baden was appointed chancellor of germany german reich in late october ludendorff in a sudden change of mind declared the conditions of the allies unacceptable he now demanded to resume the war which he himself had declared lost only one month earlier however the german soldiers were pressing to get home it was scarcely possible to arouse their readiness for battle anew and desertions were on the increase the imperial government stayed on course and ludendorff was replaced by wilhelm groener on 5 november the allies agreed to take up negotiations for a truce now also demanding reparation payments the latest note from wilson was received in berlin on 6 november that same day the delegation led by matthias erzberger departed for france also on 9 november max von baden handed over the office of chancellor to friedrich ebert a social democrat ebert s spd and erzberger s catholic centre party had enjoyed an uneasy relationship with the imperial government since bismarck s era in the imperial reichstag which had little power over the government and had been calling for a negotiated peace since 1917 their prominence in the peace negotiations would cause the new weimar republic to lack legitimacy in right wing and militarist eyes negotiation process the armistice was the result of a hurried and desperate process the german delegation headed by matthias erzberger crossed the front line in five cars and was escorted for ten hours across the devastated war zone of northern france arriving on the morning of 8 november they were then entrained and taken to the secret destination aboard ferdinand foch s private train parked in a railway siding in the forest of compigne foch appeared only twice in the three days of negotiations on the first day to ask the german delegation what they wanted and on the last day to see to the signatures the germans were handed the list of allied demands and given 72 hours to agree the german delegation discussed the allied terms not with foch but with complete german demilitarization see list below with few promises made by the allies in return the naval blockade of germany was not completely lifted until complete peace terms could be agreed upon there was no question of negotiation the germans were able to correct a few impossible demands for example the decommissioning of more submarines than their fleet possessed extended the schedule for the withdrawal and registered their formal protest at the harshness of allied terms but they were in no position to refuse to sign on sunday 10 november they were shown newspapers from paris to inform them that the kaiser had abdicated that same day erzberger was instructed to sign by ebert the cabinet had earlier received a message from hindenburg requesting that the armistice be signed even if the allied conditions could not be improved on the armistice was agreed at 5am on 11 november to come into effect at 11am paris time 12 noon german time for which reason the occasion is sometimes referred to eleventh month signatures were made between 5 12 am and 5 20 am paris time allied

the armistice was signed in a carriage of foch s private train ciwl 2419 compigne wagon it was later put back into regular service with the compagnie des wagons lits but after a short period it was withdrawn to be attached to the french presidential train from april 1921 to april 1927 paris in november 1927 it was ceremonially returned to the forest in the exact spot where the armistice was signed marshal foch general weygand and many others watched it being placed in a specially constructed building the clairiere de larmistice there it remained a monument to the defeat of the kaiser s germany until 22 june 1940 when swastika bedecked german staff cars bearing adolf hitler hermann gring wilhelm keitel joachim von ribbentrop and others swept into the clairiere and in that same carriage demanded and received the surrender armistice from france during the occupation of france the clairiere de larmistice was destroyed and the carriage taken to berlin where it was exhibited in the lustgarten after the allied advance into germany in early 1945 the carriage was removed by the germans for safe keeping to the town of ohrdruf but as an american armoured column entered the town the detachment of the ss guarding it set it ablaze and it was destroyed some pieces also exhibited at compigne after the war the compigne site was restored but not until armistice day 1950 was a

cease on all fronts at 11 a m to day an official communique was published by the united states at 2 30 pm in accordance with the terms of the armistice hostilities on the fronts of the american armies were suspended at eleven o clock this morning news of the armistice being signed was officially announced towards 9 am in paris one hour later foch accompanied by a british admiral presented himself at the ministry of war where he was immediately received by georges clemenceau the prime minister of france at 10 50 am foch issued this general order hostilities will cease on the whole front as from november 11 at 11 o clock french time the allied troops will not until further order go beyond the five minutes later clemenceau foch and the british admiral went to the lyse palace at the first shot fired from the eiffel tower the ministry of war and the lyse palace displayed flags while bells around paris rang five hundred students gathered in front of the ministry and called upon clemenceau who appeared on the balcony clemenceau exclaimed vive la france the crowd echoed him at 11 00 am the first peace gunshot was fired from fort mont valrien which told the population of paris that the armistice was concluded but the population were already aware of it from official circles and newspapers although the information about the imminent ceasefire had spread among the forces at the front in the hours before fighting in many sections of the front continued right until the appointed hour at 11 am there was some spontaneous fraternization between the two sides but in general reactions were muted a british corporal reported the germans came from their trenches bowed to us and then went away that celebrate except cookies the peace between the allies and germany was subsequently settled in 1919 by the paris peace conference and the treaty of versailles that same year last casualties many artillery units continued to fire on german targets to avoid having to haul away their spare ammunition the allies also wished to ensure that should fighting restart they would be in the most favourable position consequently there were 10 944 casualties of which 2 738 men died on the last day of the war an example of the determination of the allies to maintain pressure until the last minute but also to adhere strictly to the armistice terms was battery 4 of the us navy s long range 14 inch railway guns firing its last shot at 10 57 30 am from the verdun area timed to land far behind the german front line just before the scheduled armistice augustin trbuchon was the last

just two minutes before the armistice to the north of mons at 10 58 am to be recognized as one of the last killed with a monument to his name and finally american henry gunther is generally recognized as the last soldier killed in action in world war i he was killed 60 seconds before the armistice came into force while charging astonished german troops who were aware the armistice was nearly upon them legacy celebration of the armistice became the centrepiece of memories of the war along with salutes to the unknown soldier nations built monuments to the dead and the heroic soldiers but seldom to the generals and admirals 11 november is commemorated annually in many countries under various names such as armistice day the myth that the german army was stabbed in the back by the social democratic government that was formed in november 1918 was created by reviews in the german press that grossly misrepresented general frederick barton maurice s book the last four months ludendorff made use of the reviews to convince hindenburg the australian wood duck maned duck or maned goose chenonetta jubata is a anatinae taxonomy the flightless new zealand species chenonetta finschi finsch s duck which was formerly believed to constitute a monotypic genus euryanas has been determined to belong to chenonetta it became extinct before scientists could properly survey the new zealand avifauna but possibly as late as 1870 based on a report of a flightless goose caught in opotiki description this 4551 cm duck looks like a small goose and feeds mostly by grazing in flocks the male is grey with a dark brown head and mottled breast the female has white stripes above and below the eye and mottled underparts both sexes have grey wings with black primaries and a white speculum juveniles are similar to adult females but lighter and with a more streaky breast distribution and habitat the australian wood duck is widespread is found in grasslands open woodlands wetlands flooded pastures and along the coast in inlets and bays it is also common on farmland with dams as well as around rice fields sewage ponds and in urban parks it will often be found around deeper lakes that may be unsuitable for other waterbirds foraging as it prefers to forage on land behaviour call the most common call is a loud rising gnow sound the male call is shorter and higher than the females staccato chattering is also present in flocks flight australian wood duck flies fairly slowly and low through the trees if disturbed in random manner it can fly swiftly and easily it is an accomplished flier protection australian wood duck is widespread in its range this species has benefited from agriculture developments with creation of dams and pools it is classified as game bird and killed by hunters it is also considered as pest species is not threatened and numbers are stable reproduction australian wood duck nests in cavities in trees or in nest boxes above or near water nest is made with a pile of down breeding this duck nests in a tree cavity laying 911 cream white eggs similar to the mandarin ducks the female incubates them while the male stands guard once the ducklings are ready to leave the nest the female flies to the ground and the duckling will leap to the ground and follow their parents like mandarin drakes the males also secure their ducklings closely along with the females feeding the australian wood duck eats grasses clover and other herbs and occasionally insects it is rarely seen on open water preferring to forage by dabbling in shallow water or in grasslands and crops similar species the australian wood duck can be distinguished from pygmy geese nettapus spp which are smaller have bold white face markings and are usually seen on water necks larger more duck like bills and tend to walk more upright when flying the australian wood duck is the only duck with white secondary feathers and dark wingtips various views and plumages gallery file

spanish grammar is the grammar of the spanish language espaol castellano which is a romance language that originated in north central spain and is spoken today throughout spain some twenty countries in the americas and equatorial guinea spanish is an inflected language the verbs are potentially marked for tense aspect mood person and number resulting in some fifty conjugated forms per verb the nouns form a two gender system and are marked for number pronouns can be inflected for person number gender including a residual neuter and case although the spanish pronominal system represents a simplification of the ancestral latin system spanish was the first of the european vernaculars to have a grammar treatise gramtica de la lengua castellana written in 1492 by the andalusian linguist antonio de nebrija and presented to isabella of castile at salamanca the real academia espaola rae traditionally dictates the normative rules of the spanish language as american spanish are remarkably few and someone who has learned the dialect of one area will have no difficulties using reasonably formal speech in the other however pronunciation does vary as well as grammar and vocabulary recently published comprehensive spanish reference grammars in english include and verbs every spanish verb belongs to one of three form classes characterized by the infinitive ending ar er or ir sometimes called the first second and third conjugations respectively a spanish verb has nine indicative tenses with more or less direct english equivalents the present tense i walk the preterite i walked the imperfect i was walking or i used to walk the present perfect i have walked the past perfect also called the pluperfect i had walked the future i will walk the the conditional simple i would walk and the conditional perfect i would have walked in most dialects each verb tense has potentially six forms varying for first second or third person and for singular or plural number in the second person spanish maintains the so called t v distinction between familiar and formal modes of address the formal second person pronouns usted ustedes take third person verb forms the second person familiar plural is expressed in most of spain with the pronoun vosotros and its characteristic verb forms e g comis you plural eat while in latin american spanish that part of the paradigm is merged with the formal second person plural e g ustedes comen in other words in latin america the familiar formal distinction in the second person is not maintained in the plural in many areas of latin america the second person familiar singular pronoun t is replaced by vos which frequently requires its own characteristic verb forms especially in the present indicative where the endings are s s and s for ar er ir verbs respectively see voseo in the tables of paradigms below the optional subject pronouns appear in parentheses present indicative the present indicative is used to express actions or states of being in a present time frame for example yo soy alto i am tall ella canta en el club she sings in the club todos nosotros vivimos en un submarino amarillo we all live in a yellow submarine is ten

person l ella vive ellos ellas viven past tenses spanish has a number of verb tenses used to express actions or states of being in a past time frame the two that are simple in form formed with a single word rather than being compound verbs are the preterite and the imperfect preterite the preterite is used to express actions or events that took place in the past and which were instantaneous or are viewed as completed for example ella se muri ayer she died yesterday pablo apag las luces pablo turned i ate the rice te cortaste el pelo you had your hair cut preterite forms of the regular ar

note that 1 for ar and ir verbs but not er the first person plural form is the same as that of the present indicative and 2 er and ir verbs share the same set of endings imperfect or copretrito the imperfect expresses actions or states that are viewed as ongoing in the past for example yo era cmico en el pasado i was comical in the past usted coma sentence is saying you used to eat a lot saying that in the past the person being referred had a characteristic of eating a lot ellos escuchaban la radio they were listening to the radio all three of the sentences above describe non instantaneous actions that are viewed as continuing in the past the characteristic in the first sentence and the action in the second were continuous not instantaneous occurrences in the third sentence the speaker

singular share the same form and 2 verbs share the same set of endings using preterite and imperfect together the preterite and the imperfect can be combined in the same sentence to express the occurrence of an event in one clause during an action or state expressed in another clause for example ellos escuchaban la radio cuando oyeron un ruido afuera they were listening to the radio when they heard a noise outside yo estaba en mi cuarto cuando usted entr i was in my room when you came in era un da muy tranquilo cuando eso pas it was a very peaceful day when that happened in all three cases an event or completed action interrupts an ongoing state or action for example in the second sentence the speaker states that he was in his room expressed through the imperfect to reflect the ongoing or unfinished state of being there when the other person interrupted that state by entering expressed through the preterite to suggest a completed action progressive both are used to express ongoing progressive action in the present and past respectively for example estoy haciendo mi tarea i am doing my homework estamos estudiando we are studying estaba escuchando la radio i was listening to the radio l estaba limpiando su cuarto he was cleaning his room the present progressive is formed by first conjugating the verb estar or seguir depending on context to the subject and then attaching a gerund of the verb that follows the past imperfect progressive simply requires the estar or seguir to be conjugated depending on context in imperfect with respect to the subject forming gerunds to form gerunds in an ar verb replace the ar in the infinitive with ando i e jugar hablar caminar jugando hablando caminando for er or ir verbs replace the er or ir ending with iendo i e comer escribir dormir comiendo stem change since it is an irregular verb verbs that end with two vowels and a consonant such as leer traer creer have a special exception i e leer traer creer leyendo trayendo creyendo verbs that end with eir such as rer and sonrer have yet another exception i e rer frer riendo friendo subjunctive the subjunctive of a verb is used to express certain connotations in sentences such as a wish or desire a demand an emotion uncertainty or doubt present subjunctive normally a verb would be conjugated in the present indicative to indicate an event in the present frame of time yo soy muy ambicioso i am very ambitious marta trae la comida marta brings the food if the sentence is trying to express a desire demand or emotion or something similar in the present tense the subjunctive is used quiero que seas muy ambicioso i want you to be i want that you be very ambitious me alegro de que marta traiga la comida i am happy that marta brings the food es una lstima que llegues tarde it is a shame that you arrive late the subjunctive is also used to convey doubt denial or uncertainty busco un amigo que sea simptico i search for a friend who will be likable or i search for a likable friend no hay ningn autor que lo escriba there are no authors who write that es posible que ella sepa mucho it is possible that she knows a lot no parece que tengan mucho dinero it does not seem that they have much money in the first two examples the ideally likable friend has not yet been found and remains an uncertainty exist in the third possibility is not certainty but rather a conjecture and the last expresses clear doubt thus subjunctive is used some of the phrases and verbs that require sentences to have subjunctive formation include dudar negar esperar alegrarse de temer sentir pedir aconsejar exigir desear querer mandar es necesario que conviene que no parece que es dudoso que es probable que no creo que importa que parece mentira que some phrases that require the indicative instead because they express certainty include es verdad que es obvio que es seguro que parece que es evidente que creo que to form the subjunctive first take the present indicative first person yo form of a verb for example the verbs hablar comer and escribir to talk to eat to write yo hablo yo como yo escribo then replace the ending o is in the following if the verb is an er or ir verb such as comer poder escribir or compartir replace the ending o with an a i e yo como yo puedo yo escribo yo coma yo pueda yo escriba if the verb is an ar verb such as caminar or hablar replace the ending o with an e i e yo hablo yo camino yo hable yo camine this forms the first person conjugation the others are as follows yo yo hable yo coma yo escriba t t hables t comas t escribas l ella usted l hable l coma l escriba nosotros nosotros hablemos nosotros comamos nosotros escribamos vosotros vosotros hablis vosotros comis vosotros escribis ellos ellas ustedes ellos hablen ellos coman ellos escriban since the vos forms are derived from vosotros the following would be expected and used vos coms vos escribs however the spanish royal academy based in argentinian usage recommends to use the same forms used for t vos vos hables vos comas vos escribas imperfect subjunctive today the two forms of the imperfect subjunctive are largely interchangeable the se form derives as in most romance languages from the latin pluperfect subjunctive while the ra form derives from the latin pluperfect indicative the use of one or the other is largely a matter of personal taste and dialect many only use the ra forms in speech but vary between the two in writing many may spontaneously use either or even prefer the rarer se forms the imperfect subjunctive is formed for basically the same reasons as the present subjunctive but is used for other tenses and time frames nouns spanish has nouns of two genders masculine and feminine adjectives spanish generally uses adjectives in a similar there are three key differences between english and spanish adjectives in spanish adjectives usually go after the noun they modify the exception is when the writer speaker is being slightly emphatic or even poetic about a particular quality of an object rather than the mundane use of using the quality to specify which particular object they are referring to mi casa roja could either mean that there are many red houses in the world but i wish to talk about the one that i happen to own or that i have many houses but am referring to the red one mi casa roja my house the red one mi roja casa means that i am stressing how red my particular house is probably the only house i have mi roja casa my house which is obviously red in spanish adjectives agree with what they refer to in terms for example taza cup is feminine so the red cup is la taza roj u a u but vaso glass is masculine so the red glass is el vaso roj u o u in spanish it is perfectly normal to let an adjective stand in for a noun or pronounwith where people are involved no implication of condescension or rudeness for example los altos means the tall ones or the tall men el grande means the big one or the big man determiners spanish uses determiners in a similar way to english the main difference is that they agree with what they refer to in terms of both number singular plural and gender

a masculine noun then we can say that el perro es suyo the dog is hers with a masculine possessive to agree with the noun perro other determiners indefinite quantity poco little mucho a lot bastante enough cardinals un una one dos two tres three ordinals primero first segundo second tercero third cardinal and ordinal numbers are adjectives of amount like mucho and poco and precede nouns dos animales two first person primero and tercero drop their final o before a masculine singular noun thus el primer libro the first book el tercer ao the third year interrogative qu what cul which the cardinal numbers greater than un una and the interrogative qu are indeclinable the indefinite quantifiers ordinals un and cul are declined as adjectives pronouns spanish has a range of pronouns that in some ways work quite differently from english ones they include yo t vos usted l ella ello nosotros vosotros ustedes ellos ellas esto eso aquello context but it is not rare to see one in written text or in the spoken language whether it be for emphasis or in cases where there may be some confusion between conjugations prepositions spanish has a relatively large number of prepositions and does not use postpositions the following list is traditionally recited a ante bajo cabe con contra de desde en entre hacia hasta para por segn sin so sobre tras lately two new prepositions have been added durante and mediante usually placed at the end to preserve the list which is usually learnt by heart by spanish students this list includes two archaic prepositions so and cabe but leaves out two new latinisms va and pro as well as a large number of very important compound prepositions prepositions in spanish do english for example to translate run out of water run up a bill run down a pedestrian run in a thief into spanish requires completely different verbs and not simply the use of correr run plus the corresponding spanish prepositions this is more due to the nature of english phrasal verbs rather than an inherent function of spanish verbs or prepositions conjunctions the spanish conjunctions y and and o or alter their form in both spoken and written language to e and u respectively when followed by an identical vowel sound thus padre e hijo father and son fernando e isabel ferdinand and isabella sujeto u objeto subject or object vertical u horizontal vertical or horizontal the change does not of a diphthong as in acero y hierro steel and iron nor does the conjunction y change when initial in a question where it serves to introduce or reintroduce a name as a topic rather than to link one element with another as in y ins what about ins when the conjunction o appears between numerals it is usually spelled with an accent mark in order to distinguish it from zero 0 thus 2 3 2 or 3 in contrast to 203 two hundred three syntactic variation cleft sentences a cleft sentence is one formed with the copular verb generally with a dummy pronoun like it as its subject plus a word that cleaves the sentence put emphasis on a part of the sentence here are some examples of english sentences and their cleft versions i did it it was i who did it or colloquially it was me that did it you will stop smoking through willpower it is through willpower that you will stop smoking spanish does not usually employ such a structure in simple sentences the translations of sentences like these can be readily analyzed as being normal sentences containing relative pronouns spanish is capable of expressing such concepts without a special cleft structure thanks to its flexible word order for example if we translate a cleft sentence such as it was juan who lost the keys we get fue juan el que perdi las llaves whereas the english sentence uses a special structure the spanish one does not the verb fue has no dummy subject and the pronoun el que is not a cleaver but a nominalising relative pronoun meaning the male one and las llaves we can play with the word order of the spanish sentence without affecting its structure although each permutation would to a native speaker give a subtly different shading of emphasis for example we can say juan fue el que perdi las llaves juan was the one who lost the keys or el que perdi las llaves fue juan the one who lost the keys was juan as can be seen from the translations if this word order is chosen english stops using the cleft structure there is no more dummy it and a nominalising relative is used instead of the cleaving word whilst in spanish no words have changed here are some examples of such sentences fue juan u el que u perdi las llaves it was john who lost the keys son slo tres das u los que u te quedan it is only three days that you have left lo diga it will be i who tells him son pocos u los que u vienen y se quedan lit it is not many who come and stay note that it is ungrammatical to try to use just que to cleave such sentences as in english but using quien in singular or quienes in plural is grammatical fue juan u que u perdi las llaves incorrect fue juan u quien u perdi las llaves correct when prepositions come into play things become complicated structures unambiguously identifiable as cleft sentences are used the verb ser introduces the stressed element and then there is a nominaliser both of these are preceded by the relevant preposition for example fue u a m a quien u le dio permiso it was me to whom he gave permission lit es u para nosotros para quienes u se hizo esto it is us for whom this was made lit it is for us for whom this was made es u por eso por lo que u lo hice that is why i did it more literally it is because of that that i did it or completely literally it is because of that because of which i did it es as u como u se debe hacer it is this way that it must be done lit it is this way how it must be done como replaces longer expressions such as la forma en que this structure is quite wordy and is therefore often avoided by not using a cleft sentence at all emphasis is conveyed just by word order and stressing with the voice indicated here within bolding me dio permiso u to me se hizo esto u para nosotros u this was done for us u por eso u lo hice i did it because of that se debe hacer u as u it must be done this way in casual speech the complex cleaving pronoun is often reduced to que just as it is reduced to that in english foreign learners are advised to avoid this es para nosotros u que u se hizo esto es por eso u que u lo hice fue a m u que u le dio permiso preferred a quien es as u que u se debe hacer preferred como in the singular the subordinate clause can agree either with the relative pronoun or with the subject of the main sentence though plural only agreement with the subject of the main sentence is acceptable therefore singular yo fui el que u me lo beb u i was the one who drank it agreement with subject of main sentence yo fui el que u se lo bebi u preferred form with same meaning agreement with el que la que lo u s u soy yo i am the one who knows agreement with subject of main sentence la que lo u sabe u soy yo preferred form with same meaning agreement with la que plural somos los nicos que no u tenemos u ni un centavo para apostar we are the only ones who do not have even a cent to bet agreement with subject of main sentence from dialogue of the gabriel garca mrquez novel el vosotras sois las que lo u sabis u you girls are the ones who know agreement with subject of main sentence dialectal variations forms of address the use of usted and ustedes as a polite form of address is universal however there are variations in informal address ustedes replaces vosotros in much of andalusia the canary islands and latin america except in the liturgical or poetic of styles in some parts of andalusia the pronoun ustedes is used with the standard vosotros endings depending on the region latin americans may also replace the singular t with usted or vos the choice of pronoun is a tricky issue and can even vary from village to village travellers are often advised to play it safe and call everyone usted other areas where syllable final s is completely silent is that there is no audible difference between the second and third person singular form of the verb this leads to redundant pronoun use for example the tagging on of t ves pronounced tuv to the ends of sentences where other speakers would say ves voseo vos was used in medieval castilian as a polite form like the french vous and the italian voi and it used the same forms as vosotros this gave three levels of formality t quieres vos queris originally queredes vuestra merced quiere today usted whereas vos was lost in standard spanish some dialects lost t as the informal pronoun the exact connotations of this practice called voseo depend on the dialect in certain countries there may be socioeconomic implications el voseo uses the pronoun vos for t but maintains te as an object pronoun and tu and tuyo as possessives in voseo verbs corresponding to vos in the present indicative roughly equivalent to the english simple present are formed from the second person plural the form for vosotros if the second person plural ends in is or is the form for vos drops the i vosotros hablis vos habls vosotros tenis vos tens similarly the verb ser to be has vosotros sois vos sos if the second person plural ends in s with vos is identical vosotros vivs vos vivs vosotros os vos os vosotros hus vos hus in the imperative the form for vos is also derived from the second person plural the latter ends always in d so for the form for vos this d is removed and if the verb has more than one syllable an accent is added to the last vowel tened vosotros ten vos dad vosotros da vos the only exception to these rules is in the verb ir to go which does not have an imperative form for vos and uses the analogous form of the verb andar which has a similar meaning and is regular andad and in the present subjunctive the same rules as for the present indicative apply though these forms coexist in argentina with those for the pronoun t que vosotros digas que vos digas other tenses always have the same form for vos as for t outside argentina other combinations are possible for instance people in maracaibo may use standard vosotros endings for vos vos hablis que vos hablis vosotros imperative ar for ad in spain colloquially the infinitive is used instead of the normative imperative for vosotros this is not accepted in the normative language venir instead of venid callaros instead of callaos callarse in some dialects iros or marcharos instead of idos non normative s on t form normatively has an s ending in the second person singular of the preterite or simple past for example lo hicistes instead of the normative lo hiciste hablastes t for hablaste t this is the only instance in which the t form does not end in an s in the normative language ladino has gone further with hablates third person object pronoun variation the third person direct and indirect object pronouns exhibit variation from region to region from one individual to another and even within the language of single individuals the real academia espaola prefers an etymological usage namely one in which the indirect object function is carried by le regardless of gender and the direct object function is carried by la or lo according to the gender of the antecedent and regardless of of le as a direct object form for masculine animate antecedents i e male humans deviations from these approved usages are named lesmo for the use of le as a direct object and lasmo and losmo for the use of la and lo as indirect objects each of these usages is further described in its own wikipedia article this object pronoun variation is studied in detail by quesmo and dequesmo noun clauses in spanish are typically introduced by the complementizer que and such a noun clause may serve as the object of the preposition de resulting in the sequence de que in the standard language this sequence in turn is often reduced colloquially to just que and this reduction is by way of hypercorrection i e in an apparent effort to avoid the error of quesmo insert de before que in contexts where it is not prescribed in the standard grammar this insertion of extraneous de before que called dequesmo is generally associated with less educated speakers gaius julius caesar was a name used by men of the gens julia in ancient rome it was the full name tria nomina of the famous julius caesar and was the name of several prominent men including his father

giving it the legal right to claim a copy of every book published in great britain in the following centuries the library added books and manuscripts to the collections by purchase as well as legal deposit creating a national library in all but name by the 1920s the upkeep of such a major collection was too much for a private body and with an endowment of 100 000 provided by sir alexander grant of forres the library s contents were presented to the nation the national library of scotland was formally constituted by an act of parliament in 1925 sir alexander grant gave a further 100 000 making his combined donations the equivalent of around 6 million today for a new library building to be constructed on george iv bridge replacing the very grand victorian edinburgh sheriff court which moved matched sir alexander s donation work on the new building was started in 1938 interrupted by the second world war and completed in 1956 the architect was reginald fairlie the architectural sculptor was hew lorimer the coat of arms above the entrance was sculpted by scott sutherland by the 1970s room for the ever expanding collections was running out and it was obvious that other premises were needed the causewayside building opened in the south side of edinburgh in two phases in 1989 and in 1995 at a total cost of almost 50 million providing much needed additional working space and storage facilities since 1999 the library has been funded by the scottish parliament it remains one of only six legal deposit libraries in the united kingdom and ireland and is governed by a board of trustees the library also holds many ancient family manuscripts including those of the clan sinclair which date back as far as 1488 on 26 february 2009 areas of the building were flooded

officially began on june 1 1977 activity began several days later with the formation of a tropical depression on june 13 although 16 tropical depressions formed it was a below average season because only 6 of them strengthened into tropical storms in terms of named storms this was the hurricane status in addition one tropical cyclone eventually attained major hurricane status which is category 3 or higher on the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale the inactivity was attributed to a el nio that began developing in august three hurricanes and one tropical storm made landfall during the season causing 11 deaths and 13 million in damage the last storm of the season tropical depression thirteen dissipated on november 7 over three weeks before the official end of the season on november 30 tropical cyclogenesis in the 1977 atlantic hurricane season began with the development of a tropical depression on june 13 activity briefly halted until two other tropical depression developed in the second half of july a fourth tropical depression formed in early august later that month hurricane anita developed on august 29 as september is the climatological peak of hurricane season it was the most active month five tropical cyclones developed including two tropical depressions and hurricanes babe clara and dorothy there were also five tropical evelyn and tropical storm frieda the final tropical cyclone of the season tropical depression nine developed between the greater antilles and bermuda on november 3 and dissipated by november 7 the season s activity was reflected with a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy ace rating of 25 which was the lowest ace value since 1946 ace is broadly speaking a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces ace is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots 39 mph 63 km h or tropical storm strength subtropical storms are not included therefore the subtropical stage of babe is omitted from the total ace value storms hurricane anita a tropical wave spawned a tropical depression at 1200 utc on august 29 while located about 230 miles 370 km south southwest of new orleans louisiana the on august 30 later that day the storm had intensified into a hurricane although intensification briefly slowed rapid deepening occurred from september 1 to the following day when anita peaked as a category 5 hurricane with winds of 175 mph 280 km h the storm weakened slightly to a category 4 hurricane before making landfall near soto la marina tamaulipas it rapidly weakened inland decreasing to tropical depression intensity early on september 3 however anita remained intact

depression formed between the greater antilles and bermuda on november 3 initially the depression moved northeastward though on november 4 a building high pressure area forced it to track north of due west eventually an upper level low situated over the southern united states caused the depression to re curve north northwestward late on november 7 the depression made landfall near cape lookout north carolina by early on the following day the depression degenerated into a low pressure area while located mid atlantic and new england before being absorbed by an extratropical cyclone while offshore of maine on november 11 moisture from tropical depression nine and a low pressure area that tracked across the southeastern united states resulted in heavy rainfall over western north carolina and western virginia with up to 11 63 in at idlewild in the former in north carolina flooding destroyed 384 homes 382 mi of highways and 12 dams flooding was considered the worst in yancey county where nearly every bridge was washed out sixteen counties in the western portions of the state were declared disaster areas the depression also produced 5to9 in of rainfall in northern georgia eighteen bridges were destroyed and twenty seven others were damaged in virginia 100 homes were destroyed by flooding with about the same amount suffering major damage similar impact was reported in tennessee strong winds and storm tides in new jersey caused extensive damage overall the flooding event caused 53 deaths 39 in georgia and 1 in tennessee damage totaled 203 million alone other storms in addition to the six named storm and tropical depression nine a total of nine other tropical depressions developed during the season later in june a tropical depression formed in the west central gulf of mexico on june 13 it headed north northwestward and made landfall in texas by the following day the system rapidly dissipated after moving inland the third tropical depression of the season developed in the central gulf of mexico on july 17 after tracking northward the depression struck near mobile alabama on july 18 by the following day it dissipated in central mississippi in late july another depression developed in the central gulf of mexico on july 25 no further strengthening occurred and by the following day it dissipated north of the yucatn peninsula a tropical depression developed near the west coast of africa on august 1 the system tracked westward for three days without intensifying and dissipated on august 4 the next tropical depression formed well west southwest of cape verde on september 17 the lesser antilles about three days later tropical depression four developed in the bay of campeche on september 22 however the depression remained weak and made landfall near tampico tamaulipas at around 1000 utc on september 23 later that day it dissipated while barely inland by october 1 another tropical depression formed east of the lesser antilles it headed west northwestward and dissipated on october 3 before reaching the windward islands tropical depression six developed in the central atlantic ocean on october 2 it briefly headed east southeastward before curving northwestward on october 4 the system dissipated later that day another tropical depression developed in the gulf of mexico east of the texas and mexico border on october 24 it tracked northeastward without intensification and made landfall in southeast louisiana on october 25 while still a tropical depression the system quickly weakened and dissipated over southern

1904 amp ndash april 30 1936 was a member of the iowa state patrol in the united states to date he is the only member of the patrol to have been murdered in the line of duty prior to joining the patrol pape played american football he played high school football at dubuque senior high school where he was part of the 1924 iowa state championship football team pape then played college football at the university of iowa following college he played in the national football league for the green bay packers the minneapolis red jackets the providence steam roller the boston braves and the staten island stapletons it was with the packers that he was a member of their 1930 nfl championship team he left the nfl in 1934 and returned to iowa where he attended the state police academy at camp dodge pape was appointed to the newly in august 1935 one of the first men to become an officer in the patrol on april 28 1936 pape was patrolling u s highway 61 near muscatine iowa he noticed a car that had been reported stolen after pulling the car over pape approached the car the driver roscoe barton pointed his gun at pape and ordered him into his car barton drove away with pape as his hostage a short while later pape saw an opportunity to overpower barton and the two began struggling during the struggle barton was shot in the head and pape was shot in the abdomen both men were taken to mercy hospital now genesis medical center in davenport barton died from his injuries soon after arriving at the hospital pape was treated for his gunshot wound however his condition eventually took a turn for the worse doctors were unable to transfuse blood into him because of his collapsed veins pape died at 2 40pm on april 30 he was number 40 was retired from service the death of pape is one of the main reasons the patrol began the practice of cross drawing guns in this practice officers wear their guns opposite their strong arm in theory an officer would be able to hold on to a person with their strong arm and be able to draw their weapon at the same time firkin may refer to small cask used for liquids butter salt and sometimes fish firkin a volume of beer see english brewery cask units

halomethane compounds are derivatives of methane ch sub 4 sub with one or more of the hydrogen atoms replaced with halogen atoms f cl br or i halomethanes are both naturally occurring especially in marine environments and man made most notably as refrigerants solvents propellants and fumigants many including the chlorofluorocarbons have attracted wide attention because they become active when exposed to ultraviolet light found at high altitudes and destroy the earth s protective ozone layer structure and properties like methane itself halomethanes are tetrahedral molecules the halogen atoms differ greatly in size and charge from hydrogen and from each other consequently the various halomethanes deviate from the perfect tetrahedral symmetry of methane the physical properties of the halomethanes are tunable by changes in the number and identity of the halogen atoms in general they are volatile but less so than methane because of the polarizability of the halides the polarizability of the halides and the polarity of the molecules makes flammable than methane broadly speaking reactivity of the compounds is greatest for the iodides and lowest for the fluorides production industrial routes the halomethanes are produced on a massive scale from abundant precursors i e natural gas or methanol and from halogens or halides they are usually prepared by one of three methods free radical chlorination of methane ch sub 4 sub cl sub 2 sub uv ch sub 3 sub cl hcl this method is useful for the production of ch sub 4 x sub cl sub x sub x 1 2 3 or 4 the main problems with this method are that it cogenerates hcl and it produces mixtures of different products halogenation of methanol this method is used for the production of the mono chloride bromide and

introduction of other non natural industrial materials in nature many marine organisms biosynthesize halomethanes especially bromine containing compounds small amounts of chloromethanes arise from the interaction of chlorine sources with various carbon compounds the biosyntheses of these halomethanes are catalyzed by the chloroperoxidase and bromoperoxidase enzymes respectively an idealized equation is ch sub 4 sub cl sup sup 1 2 o sub 2 sub ch sub 3 sub cl oh sup sup classes of compounds halons are usually defined as hydrocarbons where the hydrogen atoms have been replaced by bromine along with other halogens they are but simpler than the system used for freons the first digit specifies the number of carbon atoms in the molecule the second is the number of fluorine atoms the third is the chlorine atoms and the fourth is the number of bromine atoms if the number includes a fifth digit the fifth number indicates the number of iodine atoms though iodine in halon is rare any bonds not taken up by halogen atoms are then allocated to hydrogen atoms for example consider halon 1211 c f cl br 1 2 1 1 halon 1211 has one carbon atom two fluorine atoms one chlorine atom and one bromine atom a single carbon only has four bonds all of which are taken by the halogen atoms so there is no hydrogen thus its formula is cf sub 2 sub nowiki brcl nowiki and its iupac name is therefore 26

says that hfcs are up to 12 500 times as potent as carbon dioxide in global warming wealthy countries are clamping down on these gases thornton says that many countries are needlessly producing these chemicals just to get the carbon credits thus as a result of carbon trading rules under the kyoto protocol nearly half the credits from developing countries are from hfcs with china scoring billions of dollars from catching and destroying hfcs that would be in the atmosphere as industrial byproducts overview of principal halomethanes every permutation of hydrogen fluorine chlorine bromine and iodine on one carbon atom has been evaluated experimentally applications because they have many applications and are easily prepared halomethanes have been of intense commercial interest solvents low flammability and ability to dissolve a wide range of organic compounds makes this colorless liquid a useful solvent it is widely used as a paint stripper and a degreaser in the food industry it is used to decaffeinate coffee and tea as well as to prepare extracts of hops and other flavorings its volatility has led to its use as an aerosol spray propellant and as a blowing agent for polyurethane foams propellants one major use of cfcs has been as propellants of aerosols including metered dose inhalers for drugs used to treat asthma the conversion of these devices and treatments from cfc to propellants that do not have the same effect on the ozone layer is almost complete production and import is now banned in the u s fire extinguishing at high temperatures halons decompose to release halogen atoms that combine readily with active hydrogen atoms quenching flame propagation reactions even when adequate fuel oxygen and heat remain the chemical reaction in a flame proceeds as a free radical chain reaction are able to halt the fire at much lower concentrations than are required by fire suppressants using the more traditional methods of cooling oxygen deprivation or fuel dilution for example halon 1301 total flooding systems are typically used at concentrations no higher than 7 by volume in air and can suppress many fires at 2 9 v v by contrast carbon dioxide fire suppression flood systems operate from 34 concentration by volume surface only combustion of liquid fuels up to 75 dust traps carbon dioxide can cause severe distress at concentrations of 36 and has caused death by respiratory paralysis in a few minutes at 10 concentration halon 1301 causes only slight giddiness at its effective concentration of 5 and even at 15 those exposed remain conscious but impaired and suffer no long term effects experimental animals have also been exposed to 2 concentrations of halon 1301 for 30 hours per week for 4 months with no discernible health effects halon 1211 also has low toxicity although it is more toxic than halon however halon 1301 fire suppression is not completely non toxic very high temperature flame or contact with red hot metal can cause decomposition of halon 1301 to toxic byproducts the presence of such byproducts is readily detected because they include hydrobromic acid and hydrofluoric acid which are intensely irritating halons are very effective on class a organic solids b flammable liquids and gases and c electrical fires but they are unsuitable for class d metal fires as they will not only produce toxic gas and fail to halt the fire but in some cases pose a risk of explosion halons can be used on class k kitchen oils and greases fires but offer no advantages over specialised foams halon 1301 is common in total flooding systems in these systems banks of halon cylinders are kept pressurised to about 4 mpa 600 psi with compressed nitrogen and a fixed piping network leads to the protected enclosure on triggering the entire measured contents of a few seconds through nozzles designed to ensure uniform mixing throughout the room the quantity dumped is pre calculated to achieve the desired concentration typically 37 v v this level is maintained for some time typically with a minimum of ten minutes and sometimes up to a twenty minute soak time to ensure all items have cooled so reignition is unlikely to occur then the air in the enclosure is purged generally via a fixed purge system that is activated by the proper authorities during this time the enclosure may be entered by persons wearing scba there exists a common myth that this is because halon is highly toxic in fact it is because it can cause giddiness and mildly impaired perception and also due to the risk of combustion byproducts flooding systems may be manually operated or automatically triggered by a vesda or other automatic detection system in the latter case a warning siren and strobe lamp will first be activated for a few seconds to warn personnel to evacuate the area the air with fog and is accompanied by a loud disorienting noise due to environmental concerns alternatives are being deployed halon 1301 is also used in the f 16 fighter to prevent the fuel vapors in the fuel tanks from becoming explosive when the aircraft enters an area with the possibility of attack halon 1301 is injected into the fuel tanks for one time use due to environmental concerns trifluoroiodomethane cf sub 3 sub i is being considered as an alternative halon 1211 is typically used in hand held extinguishers in which a stream of liquid halon is directed at a smaller fire by a user the stream evaporates under reduced pressure producing strong local cooling as well as a high concentration of halon in the immediate vicinity of the fire in this mode fire is extinguished by cooling and oxygen deprivation at the core of the fire as well as radical quenching over a larger area after fire suppression the halon diffuses leaving no residue chemical building blocks chloromethane synthesis chlorodifluoromethane is the main precursor of tetrafluoroethylene which is the monomeric precursor to teflon safety haloalkanes are diverse in their properties making generalizations difficult few are acutely toxic but many pose risks from prolonged exposure some problematic aspects include carcinogenicity e g methyl iodide and liver damage e g carbon tetrachloride under certain combustion conditions chloromethanes convert to phosgene which is highly toxic the revolt of the admirals is a name given to an episode that took place in 1949 in which several united states navy admirals publicly disagreed with the president and the secretary of defense s plans for the reduction of the navy and their new emphasis on the strategic nuclear bombing role by the air force as the primary means by which the nation was defended the events occurred in the early post war period when the technologies of large jet aircraft the nuclear bomb and the means by which it could be delivered were in a developmental stage background following the end of world war ii the truman administration was concerned about the large deficit spending that had been necessary for the war effort to reduce expenditures truman instructed the services to draw down their forces quickly and return to a peacetime military the two main issues facing the services was the question of unification of the services under a single command and the funding that each branch would have in the markedly reduced military budget the discussion george c marshall s call for unification of the department of war and the department of the navy marshall believed that the services needed a unified overall command to better coordinate their activities and to minimize redundancy he first advanced his general ideas on the subject in november 1943 and his proposals led to what became known as the unification debates the army made a proposal of command structure which would unite the u s army the u s navy and a soon to be formed u s air force under a single united states department of defense the generals from the army air force believed that with the increased destructive power they could now apply against potential enemies big changes in the manner in which the nation was defended were warranted with the advent of the nuclear age the question arose as to what need existed for conventional military forces the air force generals believed that much of the forces of the other services were unnecessary and could be cut they held that the future for national defense lay with a long range flawed view was accepted by the administration as being correct and the meaningful existence of the other services came into jeopardy said secretary of defense louis a johnson in this environment each military branch believed their future depended on securing and defending a clear cut mission for themselves however the truman administration saw these officers as answering to and serving the truman administration and believed that their attitude in public and in congressional testimony should be in support of the administration s position along these lines came the passage of the national security act of 1947 which reorganized the military creating a means by which the various commands were coordinated under a military establishment of three equal executive departments the army navy and air force the generals of the newly formed air force propounded a new doctrine that strategic bombing particularly with nuclear weapons was the sole decisive element necessary to win any future war and was therefore the sole means necessary to deter an adversary from launching a pearl harbor like surprise attack or war which the air force and its supporters regarded as the highest national priority the air force proposed that it should be funded by the congress to build a large fleet of u s based long range strategic heavy bombers the air force generals argued that this project should receive large amounts of funding beginning with an upgraded b 36 peacemaker intercontinental bomber with four times the payload of the b 29 and twice the range the air force planned to fly the b 36 on deep raids into enemy territory using its ceiling altitude of 40 000 feet to protect it from interdiction the navy disagreed pointing to the impact the navy s carrier arm had on the outcome of the war in the pacific they argued that naval power and carrier aviation were essential to maintaining national defense admiral marc mitscher the former commander of the fast carrier task force was one such officer who publicly commented on the value of the us navy in winning the war and its value in the future defense of the nation the navy leadership believed with or without the use of nuclear weapons the navy also held a moral objection to relying upon the widespread use of nuclear weapons to destroy the major population centers of an enemy homeland the navy pointed out that with the ships they hoped to build in the future naval aviation would be able to continue in its tactical role of close air support using modern aircraft and in addition would also be able to take on the role of nuclear deterrence the uss united states was designed to handle aircraft up to 100 000 pounds which were large enough to carry the nuclear weapons of the day plans for the united states class carriers called for them carrying up to 14 heavy bombers each with enough aviation fuel for eight bombing raids per plane with a capability to run 112 nuclear weapon drops before resupply became necessary the united states class carriers would be capable of performing the nuclear deterrence mission the admirals requested funding for the building over a five year period cancellation of uss united states the first united states secretary of defense on march 28 1949 president truman replaced forrestal with louis a johnson johnson was a political appointment a former assistant to the secretary of war he had been the primary fundraiser for truman s campaign for the white house in 1948 johnson had no qualms over supporting truman s military budget reductions and accepted the air force s argument the air force disliked the navy s aircraft carriers as they were an aviation asset which the air force could not control and which the air force planners considered obsolete in the age of nuclear weapons johnson who was a staunch proponent of the new nuclear bomber force consequently sought to limit as much as possible the navy s procurement of the new large carriers to conserve funds in the markedly reduced post war military budget less than a month after taking office and without consulting congress johnson ordered cancellation of united states the navy s future and its cancellation greatly demoralized the service secretary of the navy john l sullivan and a number of high ranking admirals resigned in protest johnson did not seem disturbed by the resignations his decision to cancel united states provided him with significant economy in the military budget while demonstrating that he was in firm control of the military and able to make difficult decisions a few days later johnson announced another cost saving measure the united states marine corps aviation assets would be transferred to the air force this time his decision was met with such an uproar from congress that this plan had to

be used for sustained actions against land targets regarding the uss united states air force chief of staff hoyt vandenberg commented i accept the military capability of this ship as stated by the chief of naval operations my opposition to building it comes from the fact that i can see no necessity for a ship with those capabilities in any strategic plan against the one possible enemy the mig 15 was the soviet answer armed with a 37 mm cannon and two 23 mm cannons it had the hitting power to destroy heavy aircraft fast and with a ceiling of nearly 50 000 feet it could fly above the bomber formations and then attack down through slipping past the fighter escort operating out of airfields in china its bases were not subject to the constant attention that german airfields had received when they were operating the messerschmitt me 262 presence of the mig 15 meant daylight precision bombing had to be suspended to the b 36 the air force was not willing to risk the aircraft in combat though it did find some use as a high altitude reconnaissance aircraft plagued by frequent engine fires and high maintenance it never played a significant role the navy did get its new carriers the first of which was at 80 000 tons it was twice the size of world war ii carriers it featured an armoured flight deck that was angled allowing the carrier to launch and recover aircraft at the same time the flight deck was large enough to land the heavy high powered aircraft of the jet age and the ship was equipped with steam catapult launchers to assist them in getting airborne the design of the supercarrier has evolved through the enterprise to the nimitz class to the ford class aircraft carriers proponents of the air force doctrine saw the korean war as an anomalous event the demands of which were not relevant to soviet union however the korean war was followed by the vietnam war which in turn was followed by several smaller conflicts ultimately soviet aggression was never made manifest through a massive nuclear attack but was pressed through a series of proxy conflicts the interests of the united states extended beyond protecting the nation from a hostile invader though the idea of defeating an enemy by the use of overwhelming destructive force was appealing it did not fit the reality the nation was confronted with the us navy has the ten supercarriers of the nimitz class in active service two of the follow on gerald r ford class are currently under construction with eight more to follow through to 2040 to replace the enterprise and the nimitz class carriers the

school age during second world war the bombing range itself took the form of a chalk marker on alkborough flats and two observation posts positioned on the ridge overlooking the target an raf detachment from raf elsham wolds including two sergeants were billeted in the southern of the two observation posts bombers would take off from elsham and drop smoke bombs on the target following a bombing run a bearing on the bomb s landing site was taken from each observation post and the position of the site calculated using triangulation during one bombing run a horse was killed and another bomb narrowly missed a group of children sledging after the war agricultural workers ploughing on the flats regularly reported releasing smoke during the establishment of the alkborough flats tidal

turf maze 43 feet 13 m across of indeterminate age although referred to as a maze being unicursal having only one way in and one path through it is more accurately a labyrinth according to arthur mee s book lincolnshire the maze was cut by monks in the 12th century but white s lincolnshire directory of 1872 maintains that it was constructed in roman times as part of a game others think that while the feature is of roman origin it was later used by the medieval church for some sort of penitential purpose and only reverted to its former use as an amusement or diversion after the reformation firm documentary evidence of its existence only seems to date from 1697 however the yorkshire antiquary abraham de la pryme several families have occupied the building including the marriotts stricklands

wells low wells is a spring that discharges from a point just the south side of prospect lane north of and several yards below st john the baptist church there is no evidence suggesting how the spring became known as low wells though its position below the level of the main part of the village would seem to suggest an obvious answer the well takes the form of three which the water flows this well structure is thought to have been constructed c 1850 as this arrangement was probably to facilitate the watering of livestock a pump was installed nearby to tap the springs first and provide clean drinking water for villagers though this has now gone this well structure is thought to have been constructed c 1850 and was restored in 1986 low wells is accessible to the public from prospect lane

basincountries united states the concord river is a 16 3mikm adj mid tributary of the merrimack river in eastern massachusetts in the united states the river drains a small rural and suburban region northwest of boston one of the most famous small rivers in u s history it was the scene of an important early battle of the american revolutionary war and was the subject of a famous 19th century book by henry david thoreau description the river begins in middlesex county formed by the confluence of the sudbury and assabet rivers at egg rock near the concord town center it flows generally north from eastern concord along the northwestern edge of the boston metropolitan area joining the merrimack river from the south on the eastern side of lowell it is a gently flowing stream with little variation in topography along most of its route its drainage basin stretches into worcester county and includes 36 towns within massachusetts native americans called it the musketaquid aquatic or semi aquatic vegetation and its banks are fringed with wild grasses and sedges which stretch for miles along both sides of this placid stream this creates a good environment for a variety of fish including bass shad and alewife river herring pickerel carp and american eel native americans wove sticks in intricate designs to trap alewives and other migrating fish at the mouths of rivers throughout this region by 1635 settlers from england began to arrive and they gave the river its present name on april 19 1775 the old north bridge over the river in the town of concord was famously the scene of the battle of concord on the same day when the first shots of the revolutionary war were fired at nearby lexington the small wooden concord bridge a reproduction is preserved by the national park service henry david thoreau wrote his first book a week on the concord and merrimack rivers in 1849 while living at nearby walden the rivers with his brother john who had since died thoreau recounted his exploration of the natural beauty of the river and his accompanied thoughts on such eternal themes as truth poetry travel and friendship despite the growth of the suburbs in the vicinity of the river it remains a popular canoeing destination today the last mile of the river in lowell is serious class 3 4 whitewater dams cause fish population to decrease dams were built along the concord river to increase crop production and also to provide a source of power for operating mills by the 19th century the native population of shad and alewife became extinct because the dams prevented the mature fish from returning upstream to spawn alewife and other anadromous fish are migratory they hatch in fresh water make their way to the sea to grow then return as adults to fresh water to spawn usually near where they had hatched this instinct is imprinted within the fish when it is born so when the the faulkner dam in north billerica is just one of many blockages that caused the alewife population to collapse on the concord river at this point water was diverted north to lowell and south to charlestown to run the middlesex canal effects of pollution during the 19th century the concord river was near the heart of the us industrial revolution textile paper tanning and mining industries all emerged during this period industrial wastes were dumped into the river along with untreated sewage and other organic waste industrial development within the watershed peaked in the 1920s the early 1960s saw an increase chemical and metal firms in support of the electronics industry within the boston metropolitan area by the 1960s the merrimack river was considered one of the top ten most polluted waterways in america the concord river empties into the merrimack river the passage of the clean water act in 1972 signaled the beginning of us efforts to improve the quality of its waterways the act imposed stricter controls on point source led to the installation of three wastewater treatment plants on the banks of the concord river one in concord and two in billerica these plants have helped to prevent subsequent damage to the river ecosystem when they were able to operate within federally mandated limits pollutants such as heavy metals and pcbs remain trapped in the sediment throughout much of the sudbury river and downstream into the concord river fish consumption is banned due to mercury laden sediments from the nyanza superfund site and other sources perchlorate was detected in the concord river in august 2004 initially it was believed that explosives used in road and building construction were the source of this pollutant however an investigation by the town of billerica eventually determined that the source was a local company that produced surgical and medical materials the company was using 220 gallons per month of perchloric acid in a bleaching process and rinse water was being discharged into the sewage system after the company was identified it voluntarily shut down until ion exchange equipment could be installed billerica was the subject of legal action and forced to pay a 250 000 penalty for discharging pollutants into the concord river the action was brought by the u s environmental protection agency epa and the massachusetts department of environmental protection massdep because the town of billerica exceeded allowable effluent limits for phosphorus fecal coliform bacteria ph and ammonia nitrogen the town was also charged with failing to submit discharge monitoring reports failing to comply with monitoring requirements and failing to submit infiltration and inflow reporting according to the epa billerica s discharges of phosphorus created an overabundance of nutrients which damaged the river by stimulating excessive aquatic plant growth recovery effort in may 2000 the u s fish and wildlife service the massachusetts riverways program and volunteers from the sudbury valley trustees svt released 7 000 adult alewife river herring into the concord river they were transferred from the nemasket river so that they could lay their eggs and spawn upstream this imprinted the young alewives with the more than 1000 juvenile alewives were observed in heard pond located on the sudbury river fishery biologists in the u s fish and wildlife service hope that after three to five years in the ocean these fish will complete the cycle by swimming back to heard pond again the fishery biologists say the fish will be able to swim over the top of north billerica s faulkner dam on the way downstream however on the return trip the fish will need to be transported around the dam if a sufficient number of fish return the u s fish and wildlife service will explore options for a more permanent solution which may include modifications to the dam name thunderhill raceway park nicknames time location glenn county west of willows california usa coordinates image imagecaption capacity owner operator brokeground

earlier they are then suddenly whisked off into time and space continuity wotan refers to the doctor as doctor who the only time the character is ever given this name within the series narrative though he was credited as such in the end titles from the start of season 1 until the end of season 18 of the classic series and then again in series 1 of the meaning of the acronym tardis this serial is the only time during the black and white era of the series when the crew of the tardis is completely replaced with the doctor being the only continuing character this serial marks the last appearance of the st john ambulance emblem on the tardis exterior door until the eleventh doctor s tenure begins in 2010 s the eleventh hour the story appears to end on 20 july 1966 the date given in dialogue for the second doctor story the faceless ones also set in london where ben states that that is the same date as when he and polly joined the tardis the past doctor adventures novel the time travellers by simon guerrier is set in an alternative reality where the doctor had not been around to stop wotan the villain is never referred to by name only as the machine and while he was overthrown thousands were left insane by his mind control and britain was reduced to a technologically backward dictatorship the decision the producers felt that the audience was becoming bored with the purely historical episodes that had been a major element of the show to date as a result this story marks the beginning of the turn away from historical stories the next two historical stories the smugglers which immediately follows the war machines and season 4 s the highlanders were to be the last purely historical stories until season 19 s black orchid production working titles for this story included the computers the idea for this story came about when kit pedler was being interviewed for a position as science adviser to the series the producers asked all of the interviewees what would happen if the recently built post office tower somehow took over pedler suggested that it would be the work of a rogue computer that communicated with the outside world by means of the telephone system the producers liked this suggestion and not only offered one of the few to feature a story idea by credit pat dunlop was then hired to write a full set of teleplays from pedler s idea but quit after becoming busy with other work and the teleplays were subsequently done by ian stuart black who had also written the previous serial the savages only one war machine prop was actually constructed the production team changed the numbers to represent the different machines the titling style of each episode in this serial differs from the standard titles of other serials instead of a title overlay after the doctor who logo has faded the screen shifts to a solid background containing four inversely coloured rectangles aligned down the left hand side reminiscent to an old style computer punch card the title one word at a time scrolls upwards the war mach ines with a final flash displaying the complete title on two lines another flash reveals the writer the next flash reveals actual episode number all of the lettering displayed in this titling sequence is shown in a retro computer font each of the four episodes title sequences have slight variations to them casting sandra bryant appeared in the macra terror as did john harvey john rolfe later played sam in the moonbase and fell in the green death frank jarvis later played ankh in underworld and skart in the power of kroll michael craze provided the voice of a policeman heard in episode four wotan received a credit as and wotan at the end of the first three episodes the only time a fictional character was credited as itself in the series jackie lane s contract expired midway through production of this story she does not appear again after episode two dodo s off screen departure is relayed to the doctor by polly missing episodes aside from its soundtrack recorded off air by fans the 1970s the master videotapes for the story were the last of those starring william hartnell to be junked surviving until 1974 the 16mm film telerecording copies held by bbc enterprises were also the last of their kind to be destroyed surviving until 1978 shortly before the junking of material was halted by the intervention of fan ian levine in 1978 a collector in australia provided a copy of episode 2 later in 1984 copies of all four episodes were returned from nigeria episodes 2 3 and 4 all had cuts to them but most have been restored due to a combination of the other copy of episode 2 material used in a promotional item on the bbc s blue peter and censored clips from australia some of the restored footage did not have its accompanying soundtrack and so the missing sound was restored from the off air recordings the war machines is the last surviving complete serial from the william hartnell era the following serial while hartnell s final serial the tenth planet is missing episode 4 this serial is also the only one featuring michael craze and anneke wills as ben and polly that is complete to date only episodes 3 and 4 do not exist in their entirety as was originally intended episode 3 is missing a visual brief bit of dialogue with krimpton talking this was replaced in the vhs release with a combination of a shot of wotan with the accompanied dialogue from the off air recordings episode 3 is also missing around 59 seconds worth of the battle in the warehouse episode 4 is missing only a small amount of material the first instance occurs with the man in the telephone box part of the continuing close up of the man talking on the telephone is missing but this was compensated on the vhs release by continuing in audio only over the top of the beginning of the high shot of the phone box there are also two lines of dialogue missing when polly reports back to re instated for the vhs release as it was felt that there would n t be enough visual material to drop into the gap the dvd release has all of the episodes recreated and restored to their original length as well as a 9 minute documentary showing how the episodes were reconstructed from all the disparate sources broadcast and reception in 2009 patrick mulkern of radio times praised the contemporary edge taken with the war

around the shanballymore has three names as the heading show the earliest appears in the crichad on chaoille c 1100 and the papal taxation of pope nicholas 1291 sonnach gobunn the second name templeroan makes its appearance as an alternative name about 1400 and remains as the name of the civil legal or church of ireland parish this latter name is important as census figures and other official information for the parish will be found under this title the youngest name is shanballymore the name of the roman catholic parish that it has a history worth telling is evident from the fact that within its 3 866 acres it contained four tower houses or castles via balllinamona sonnach or shannagh castleruan and dannanstown and three churches kilelly kilclagmusey amp templeroan each will be discussed in its place there is also a reference to a shanballymore castle but that would appear to be in error for castleruahn the vicinity of shanballymore was part of the parishes as shown in the crichid an chaoilli a description of the area no known as the barony of fermoy the text appears in the book of lismore more correctly the book of mac carthaigh riabhach which was found in the

scholarly periodical eriu in 1928 and third patrick power s publication of 1932 this latter is most useful to the local historian since it has an introduction which places the work in its context a transcript and photographic reproduction of the text for the scholar in medieval irish a translation and extensive notes on places and place names power was an number of disciplines he was professor of archaeology in ucc the author of a history of the diocese of waterford a major work on the place names of the diocese and translated the lives of ss declan amp mochuda the parish is represented in

jacques is a monument located in the 4th arrondissement of paris france on rue de rivoli at rue nicolas flamel this 52mft 0 flamboyant gothic tower is all that remains of the former 16th century church of 29 2709 toolong saint james of the butchery which was leveled shortly after the french revolution a starting point for the chemin de compostelle the tower s rich decoration reflects the wealth of its patrons the wholesale butchers of the nearby les halles market the masons in charge were jean de felin julien mnart and jean de revier it was built in 1509 to 1523 during the reign of king francis i with a dedication to saint james the great the ancient church and its landmark tower welcomed pilgrims setting out on the road that led to tours and headed for the way of st james which led to the major pilgrimage destination of santiago de compostela a relic of the saint preserved in the church linked it in 1998 as a world heritage site by unesco among the sites and structures marking the chemins de compostelle the pilgrimage routes in france that led like tributaries of a great stream headed towards santiago in the northwest of spain nineteenth century the church with the exception of the tower was demolished in 1793 preservation of the tower was a condition of the contract by which the church was bought for the value of its building materials in 1824 it was being used as a shot tower to make small shot it was repurchased by the city of paris in 1836 and declared a monument historique in 1862 a statue of the saint was installed on the top of the tower during the 19th century during the second empire the architect thodore ballu restored the tower placing it on a pedestal and designing a small city park around it this coincided with the construction of the rue de rivoli and the avenue victoria nearby requiring huge quantities of earth to be removed the pedestal allowed the tower to retain its original elevation nowadays the change in ground level can best be appreciated in rue st bon just northeast of the tower where a staircase leads up to the original street level at rue de la verrerie a statue of blaise pascal is located at the base of the tower commemorating the experiments on atmospheric pressure though it is debated whether they were performed here or at the church of 25 2740 toolong a meteorological laboratory is also installed at the top of the tower the tower inspired alexandre dumas to write the play la tour 29 2767 toolong in 1856 nicolas flamel a patron of the church was buried under its floor modern restoration the tower was surrounded by scaffolding and obscured by sheeting for some years as surveyors investigated the condition of the stone recent findings show that most of the stone and its ornamentation originates from the late medieval era of the tower s construction and was not added by the 19th century restorers unfortunately three quarters of sheeting was taken down in march 2008 revealing a renovated upper section of the tower from october 2008 to february 2009 the scaffolds and sheeting were completely removed and the surrounding park s landscaping was being restored finally on the 18 april 2009 the

forsteri also known as the new zealand fur seal or southern fur seal is a species of fur seal found around the south coast of australia the coast of the south island of new zealand and some of the small islands to the south and east of there male only colonies are also located on the cook strait coast of the north island near wellington and vagrants are found as far north as new caledonia the english common name new zealand fur seal is used by english speakers in new zealand kekeno is used in the mori language and southern fur seal by english speakers in australia although the two populations show some genetic differences their morphologies are very similar and thus they remain classed as a single species although the seals look docile they can move surprisingly quickly and it is advisable never to approach a female with young or get between a seal and the water cutting off its escape route to the seal is a fairly large mammal males have been reported to be as large as 250 kg in the literature but the average weight is about 126 kg males can also grow to be 2 meters long females are between 3050 kg on average and can grow to be as long as 1 5 meters pups are 3 3 3 9 kg on average and between 40 and 55 cm long at 290 days old males are about 14 1 kg and females are about 12 6 kg they have external ears and hind flippers that rotate forward which visibly distinguish them from other seals they have a pointy nose with long pale whiskers the fur seals are covered by two layers of fur and their coat is grey brown on their back but it is lighter on their belly some fur seals have white tips on longer upper hairs which can give the fur seal a silver like appearance behavioral characteristics diving new zealand fur seals porpoise out of the water when traveling quickly at diving out of any other fur seal because they can dive deeper and longer females can dive for about 9 minutes and to a depth of about 312 meters but females can dive deeper and longer in autumn and winter males can dive for about 15 minutes to a depth of about 380 meters on average new zealand fur seals only dive for 12 minutes when they dive for food they dive deeper during the day but shallower at night because during the day their prey typically migrates to deeper depths and migrates back up during the night communication males vocalize through a bark or whimper either a gluttural threat a low intensity threat a full threat or a submissive call females growl and also have a high pitched pup attraction wail call breeding female new zealand fur seals mature between 4 and 6 years old and males mature between 8 and 10 years old these seals are polygynous males obtain and guard territory in late october before females arrive often females eight days postpartum for about 13 minutes on average females have a delayed implantation of the fertilized egg so that implantation on the uterine wall does not occur for 3 months gestation occurs for 9 months females are more aggressive near the time of birth and do not like to be approached right after birth female new zealand fur seals will continue to reproduce until their death which is on average between 14 and 17 years of age parenting pups are born between november and january females stay close to the birth site for up to ten days pups are fairly mature at birth and within 60 minutes they start suckling for about 7 minutes eventually the suckling can exceed 33 minutes suckling can occur for about 300 days pups start to eat solid food just before weaning pups are eventually weaned around september and they disperse diet their diet includes cephalopods fish and birds stomach contents have been analyzed and shown to include anchovy barracuda flounder and many other species there are different factors that affect their diet such as season sex breeding surrounding colony oceanography and climatic patterns predators new zealand fur seals known predators are killer whales sharks male new zealand sea lions and possibly leopard seals new zealand sea lions are also known to target pups as their prey human impact these seals were widely hunted from shortly after the european discovery of new zealand until the late 19th century the population of the new zealand seal fell to levels under 10 of the original numbers today trawls and fisheries are one of the main sources of death in new zealand fur seals they cause entanglement and drowning it has been estimated by the royal forest and bird protection society that over 10000 seals could have drowned in nets between 1989 and 1998 they are also known to be shot by commercial and recreational fishermen because they sometimes interfere with fishing gear how often these shootings occur is unknown is expected to increase new zealand fur seals

overcrowded they gradually moved to western sudan these stories correspond well with the presence of scores of hawazma in kosti middle sudan um rowaba eastern part of kordofan and al rahad middle eastern part of kordofan the journey continued beyond kordofan to darfur on the western sudan and today they have reached chad the country on western border of sudan wherever baggara settle they start a seasonal nomadic movement that goes from north to south to their historical migration route mostly they only follow two routes one route from north to south and different route from south to north but the routes are not far apart and they are permanent they never change them any tribe has its own routes hawazma are mostly found in routes originating from al obeid city in north kurdufan through deling city and its eastern part kadugli city and its eastern part to talodi region messiria just borders them to the west humr borders messiria to the west and so forth today the hawazma in particular and baggara in general bear little resemblance to bedouin arabs due to their acclimatization and their inter marriage with other african tribes many hawazma subtribes have dark skin and closely resemble nuba tribes and many members of these tribes speak nuba dialects fluently still some tribe names indicate their mixed origins other hawazma subtribes have preserved their arabic features light brown complexion and thick eyebrows and lashes socio ecnonomic factors pastoralism and agriculture generally hawazma settled in villages or established villages from southern parts of al obeid city in northern kordofan to talodi city in south kordofan those who settled in northern border of south kordofan or southern border of north kordofan are mostly gumaiyya including gumaiyya kilaibab gumaiyya al hussienat and gumaiyya matrafia in addition to other hawazma oulad gaboush and dar niayylie these subtribes intermarried with bidaria and mosabaat and other kordofanian tribes their lifestyle closely resembles the kordofanian tribes mostly engaged in raising crops and cattle notably their hawazma arabic accent is inclined to include kordofanian arabic accents similarly they adopted a way of cultivation crop tending and harvesting similar to those other kordofanian tribes they used a long sticked spade called jarrieh and saloqqa they tend their farm while standing not similar to those of hawazma deep in south kordofan who tend while they are sitting on their heels their crops include millet watermelon groundnuts sesame and hibiscus those who settled in the middle of south kordofan balal gumaiyya nafar ayyad gumaiyya nafar adam and others these who settled around the deling city and its suburb are mostly hawazma dar niayylie both groups have adopted the main stream hawazma way of life and their hawazma arabic accents in terms of agricultural practices they grow sorghum sesame cotton and okra they mostly use tools such as sollucab for seeding and antabab and axe for clearing shrubs and trees mostly cultivate by uprooting grasses with their bare hands these are among the most victimized hawazma during this civil wars on the southern parts of south kordofan settled hawazma al rawawqa al rawawqa subtribe embodies large subsubtribal diversity among the most prevalent are rawawqa oulad nuba these are group of hawazma who most resembles nuba in most of their living habits and agricultural practices they cultivate with jarrieh a nuba developed tool tend while sitting on their heels mostly grow sorghum sesame and groundnuts and gather wild okra again these are among the most victimized hawazma in the region hawazma darbettie now separated from those living central south kordofan due to geographic distance on the western parts of south kordofan no hawazma live their it is found our cousins messiria humr rezeigat ta isha and habbaniya they have similar lifestyles as hawazma and only differentiated by their phonetic accents of arabic language character appearance and costumes hawazma like any other baggara people have graceful slim physical statues their skins range from light brown to dark colors explorers to the region motioned that they have far better mental capabilities wit and humor than any other african tribes around them they have passion for life and collective life style the men wear a white gown called jallabiyya white pants pajamas a head cap called tagiatt big white turbans called eema and locally made leather shoes called marqoub always men of all ages carry knives which are worn on the forceps of the carry sticks spears sometimes swords or big spears the women wear a dress called foustan and cover their bodies with taubes such as indian sari young men wear eye catching colored flashy shirts shorts pants beads necklaces and bracelets young women wear foustanff during festivals and dancing to show their ornate braided hairstyles sociological issues gender health and education baggara are mostly illiterate in the early days they look to the school as a way to alienate their kids to teach them moral delinquencies to distract them from baggara way of life cattle herding and nomadic movement young baggara look after cows daylong they return to baggara camp during evening times baggara lack clean drinking water health clinics electricity television radio and other forms of media pregnant women rarely visit clinics or doctors female genital mutilation is common facial scarring called shoulokh lips sticking and braided hair are usual practices among cows prepare meals raise kids market dairy products build houses and participate in crop cultivation baggara youth are cheerful group in the baggara families their main mental set to look for festivals rituals dancing gossip around for absentinence and only supervises young kids to range cattle men are completely idle during dry seasons play dala sort of cards played with sticks and coordinate the meager activity during summer such as delivering grains to mills and bringing the daily family grocery from women s marketed dairy product money baggara raise huge herds never for marketing but for prestige the wealth and prestige is determined by the size of one s herds women crush on those with large herds the work of anthropologist barbara michael work is a large contribution to the subject of hawazma socio enonomics beginnings of conflict beginning in early 1983 radio broadcasts by south sudanese rebels alarmed the people of south kordofan and increased tensions in the area soon after weapons started to appear on the black market for service the weapons trade was flourishing with gun sellers roaming the baggara villages and nomad camps a young man without a machine gun was just like a woman to be a man you had to have a machine gun the baggara started to organize themselves as militia the militiamen given themselves roles to protect the baggara camps and fight to defend the villages nomeri s regime began arming messiria zurug and messiria humr to balance the rebel attack on abyei area the rebels attacked a chevron oil company site killing four chevron employees also they attacked the baggara campuses to acquire cattle for food now the war completely broke at southwest of south kordofan by the end of normeri s regime in 1985 south kordofan was in chaos although other parts of kordofan were peaceful during al sadiq al mahdi era the messiria zurug and messiria humr were armored the paramilitary forces became legal and carrying weapons was legal everyone had ak 47 machine gun during this time rebels attacked around talodi city the baggara were heavily victimized in gardoud sixty baggara were dead 82 wounded see the first paragraph in this report religious leaders and imams were publicly executed women were raped houses were burned and cattle herds were raided south kordofan now is a war zone people evacuated the cities traders stopped their trades and all other tribes and ethnic groups not from south kordofan left the region civil war in 1987 yusif kuwa mekki entered south kordofan as commander for the rebels immediately war expanded to el hamra el buram um sirdiba and surrounding areas hawazma villages were systematically targeted by rebels killing them as groups individuals or evacuate them completely as what was happened in um sirdiba africa justice organization provided many reports documenting abuses by spla these reports indicate the worse human rights situation in south kordofan in 1989 al boukhas village was completely destroyed and about 40 villages of hawazma were either attacked or evacuated before the attack and end of 1989 about 300 000 baggara were either relocated to big cities or displaced and resettled on the northern border of south kordofan for six years kuwa war machines six battalions were directed to systematic torturing of baggara tribes completely destroying their infrastructures and eliminating their educated youth leaders and the elite we have not seen any major attack on military compuses or major military stronghold places in south kordofan the war was directed toward baggara tribesmens in january 1990 abu safifa village was burned to the ground by february 1990 only baggara men stayed on the villages while kids women and the elderly were displaced or relocated the war became ethnic cleansings against the baggara while the west still misleaded with the ngos which look after their religious and political agenda in south kordofan desperate tribal wars rebel guerrilla fighters were looking for excitement in the news by destroying baggara villages to show their presence then escape to the mountains tops such as morou mountain or tolishi mountains nuba militia fighters tarrevera militia fighters from morou crossed the road for every vehicle evacuating baggara and executing them they placed road mines and ambushed cars when mines went off they would attack kill or loot goods and then they would escape to mountains or densely forested valleys during the military regime of president omar hassan al bashir which came to power in june 1989 by revolting against elected prime minister sadiq al mahdi government south kordofan entered a new phase of the civil war islamic jihad war against infidels was completely the norm of life in south kordofan religious decrees fatwas were declared urging people to join the war baggara are 100 percent muslims and 75 percent of nuba are muslims then who was the islamic war against however due to desperation of baggara following the unspeakable atrocities by rebels they sided with the military forces to protect themselves soon yusuf kuwa and rebels fighters realized the effect of baggara on the war balance basically attributed to their the baggara lead the government forces to caves and hiding places for the rebels rebels commander yusif kuwa mekki started to negotiate with baggara either to take side with him or at least to refrain from supporting the government army against the rebels yusuf kuwa successed in convening and writing many mutual agreements with local baggara leaders baggara held good to their agreements this came to disadvantage the government the government thereafter started a full swing against baggara who hold to their agreements by jailing torturing or killing or forcing them to refrain from any agreements as of today with peace agreement in progress baggara has nothing to negotiate they were used abused and victimized by the rebels and the government forces ngos never came to baggara villages to report the atrocities and probably assumed not deserving any human rights lieutenant general walter david alexander lentaigne cb cbe dso 15 july 1899 24 june 1955 was a british indian army

new chief of the chindits was major general lentaigne he was one of wingate s closest disciples and a veteran of the burma fighting amongst his rivals for the position including mike calvert and derek tulloch there was criticism of this decision they alleged that lentaigne was the chindit leader least in tune with wingate s methods and tactics they also pointed out that he had commanded 111 indian brigade in the field for only a few weeks after the war certain of his rivals used the comments of his brigade major john masters with regard to lentaigne s age out of context to attack him lentaigne had been a distinguished battalion commander who had fought during the 1942 burma campaign the other chindit brigade commanders were unknown quantities lacking staff college qualifications or significant time in command of even a battalion sized formation additionally there was no clear successor to thought that they would have been or were wingate s obvious successor field marshal lord slim wrote in his memoirs of the burma war defeat into victory that after wingate s death at least three officers went to him and told him separately and confidentially that wingate had designated each of them as the divisional commander in the event of his death postwar career in his book red coats to olive green colonel v longer has listed lentaigne as one of the handful of british general

backbone computer networks that made up the national science foundation network nsfnet many of the internet communications standards and protocols as we know it today were developed by suranet how suranet started by the mid 1980s it was clear that access to high capacity computer resources would be needed to facilitate scientific collaboration among the southeastern universities research association sura member institutions a high performance network to provide this access was essential but no single institution could afford to develop such a system sura stepped up to the challenge and with support from the u s national science foundation nsf and sura universities suranet was up and running in 1987 and was part of the first phase of national science foundation network nsfnet funding as the agency built a network to facilitate scientific collaboration suranet was one of the first and one of the largest internet providers in the united states sura sites first used a 56 kbit s backbone in in 1989 and to a 45 mbit s ds3 backbone in 1991 fix east and mae east both major peering points were located at the main sura facilities large scale collaboration among sura affiliated scientists became an everyday reality role of suranet in the development of the internet suranet participated in the development of internet communications standards and telecommunications protocols that enabled researchers and federal agencies to communicate and work in this early internet environment suranet was one of the first nsfnet regional networks to become operational suranet provided

harapiak were both ndp cabinet ministers during the 1980s wowchuk was first elected to the manitoba legislature in the 1990 provincial election defeating incumbent progressive conservative parker burrell in the riding of swan river she was re elected in the 1995 election defeating tory candidate fred betcher by only 36 votes there are many who believe that independent native voice candidate nelson contois who received 118 votes was encouraged to run by local tory organizers in an attempt 1995 wowchuk supported lorne nystrom s campaign to become leader of the federal new democratic party after spending nine years as an opposition mla wowchuk moved to the government benches in 1999 after gary doer s ndp won a parliamentary majority she was appointed minister of agriculture and food on

cooperative development on june 25 on november 4 the name of her ministry was changed to agriculture food and rural initiatives and she was relieved of responsibilities for intergovernmental affairs although wowchuk opposed the decision of gary filmon s government to eliminate the single desk marketing of hog farms she did not reverse the policy upon joining government in 2004 that all livestock animals killed in a proposed winnipeg plant be tested for bse wowchuk was also named acting minister of intergovernmental affairs and trade on may 18 2004 following the resignation of mary ann

current on the west side of the north pacific ocean it is similar to the gulf stream in the north atlantic and is part of the north pacific ocean gyre like the gulf stream it is a strong western boundary current physical properties it begins off the east coast of taiwan and flows northeastward past japan where it merges with the easterly drift of the north pacific current it is analogous to the gulf stream in the atlantic ocean transporting warm tropical water northward toward the polar region it is sometimes known as the black stream the english translation of kuroshio and an allusion to the deep blue of its water and also as the the path of kuroshio south of japan is reported every day its counterparts are the north pacific current to the north the california current to the east and the north equatorial current to the south the warm waters of the northernmost coral reefs in the world the branch into the sea of japan is called the japan current is responsible for the mild weather experienced around alaska s southern coast and in british columbia biological properties distribution western boundary currents transport organisms long distances rapidly and a variety of commercially important marine organisms migrate in these currents in the course of completing their lives subtropical gyres occupy a large fraction of the world s ocean and are more productive than originally thought in addition their fixation of carbon dioxide is an important factor in the global budget for carbon dioxide in the atmosphere satellite images of the kuroshio current illustrates how the current path meanders and forms isolated rings or eddies on the order of 100 amp ndash 300 km eddies retain their unique form for several months and have their own biological characteristics that depend on where they form if the eddies are formed between the current and coastline of japan they may impinge on the continental shelf their high kinetic energy has the effect one side of the ring while adding water to the other side the eddies size and strength decline with distance from major ocean currents the amount of energy decreases from the rings associated with the major currents and down to eddies remote from those currents cyclonic eddies have the potential to cause upwelling that would affect the global primary production budget upwelling brings cold nutrient rich water to the surface resulting in an increase in productivity the biological consequences for young fish populations that inhabit the shelf are quite large production impact of eddies the kuroshio is a warm current 24 c annual average sea surface temperature about 100 km wide and produces frequent small to meso scale eddies the kuroshio current is ranked as a moderately high productivity ecosystem with primary production of 150 to 300 grams of carbon per square meter per year based on seawifs global primary productivity estimates the coastal areas are highly productive and the maximum chlorophyll value is found around 100 meters depth there are indications that eddies by the kuroshio plankton biomass fluctuates yearly and is typically highest in the eddy area of the kuroshios edge warm core rings are not known for having high productivity however the biology of the warm core rings from the kuroshio current show results of productivity equally distributed throughout for a couple of reasons one is upwelling at the periphery the other is the convective mixing caused by the cooling of surface water as the ring moves north of the current the thermostad is the deep mixed layer that has discrete boundaries and uniform temperature within this layer nutrient rich water is brought to the surface which generates a burst of primary production given that the water in the core of a ring has a different temperature regime than the shelf waters there are times when a warm core ring is undergoing its spring bloom while the surrounding shelf waters are not there are many complex interactions with the warm core ring and thus lifetime productivity is not very different from the surrounding shelf water a study in 1998 found that the primary in the cold jet outside it with evidence of upwelling of nutrients within the ring in addition there was discovery of dense populations of phytoplankton at the nutricline in a ring presumably supported by upward mixing of nutrients furthermore there have been acoustic studies in the warm core ring which showed intense sound scattering from zooplankton and fish populations in the ring and very sparse acoustic signals outside of it copepods have been used as indicator species of water masses it has been suggested that copepods have been transported from the kuroshio current into southwest taiwan through the luzon strait the kuroshio intrusion through the luzon strait and further into the south china sea may explain why copepods show a very high diversity in adjacent waters of the intrusion areas the kuroshio current intrusion has a major influence on c sinicus and e concinna which are two copepod species with higher index values for winter and originate from the east china sea during the southwestern monsoon the south china sea surface as a result of this water circulation the zooplankton communities in the boundary waters are unique and diverse fish the biomass of fish stocks depends on the biomass of lower trophic levels primary production and on oceanic and atmospheric conditions in the kuroshio oyashio region the fish catches depend on oceanographic conditions such as the oyashios southward intrusion and the kuroshios large meander south of honshu the oyashio current contains subarctic water that is much colder and fresher than the resident water east of honshu thus the oyashio intrusion affects recruitment biomass and catch of species such as pollock sardine and anchovy when the oyashio is well developed and protrudes southward the cold waters are favorable for sardine production the kuroshio large meander development correlates with sardine recruitment and catch due to the proximity of the kuroshio meander to the southern spawning grounds of sardine squid the japanese squid todarodes pacificus has three stocks that breed in winter summer and autumn the winter spawning in january to april in the east china sea the larvae and juveniles travel north with the kuroshio current they are turned inshore and are caught between the islands of honshu and hokkaido during the summer the summer spawning is in another part of the east china sea from which the larvae are entrained into the tsushima current that flows north between the islands of japan and the mainland afterward the current meets a southward flowing cold coastal current the liman current and the summer spawned squid are fished along the boundary between the two this illustrates the use of these western boundary currents as a rapid transport that enable the eggs and larvae to develop during winter in warm water while the adults travel with minimum energy expenditure to exploit the rich northern feeding grounds studies have reported that annual catches in japan have gradually increased since the late 1980s and it has been proposed that changing environmental conditions have caused the autumn and winter spawning areas in the tsushima strait and near the goto islands to overlap in slope in the east china sea are expanding seclusion is the act of secluding i e shutting out or keeping apart from society or the state of being secluded or a place that facilitates it a secluded place a person a couple or a larger group may go to a secluded place for privacy or because the place is quiet seclusion of a single person is also called solitude restrictions on the seclusion of a man and a woman in some cases where there are legal religious or social restrictions on two people having physical intimacy there may be restrictions on being together in a secluded place for example under traditional schools of sharia or islamic law a man and a woman who are not married and not mahram being together in a house a room a bathroom or a secluded place may be forbidden a man and woman could be in a secluded area for work purposes just talking or anything that does not allow them to pass their limits as a therapy seclusion may be used as a control tactic in psychiatric treatment settings seclusion of an agitated person in a quiet room free of stimulation may help de escalate a situation which may be dangerous to the agitated person or those around him in relation to administering medications seclusion is a tactic devised for those unwilling to proceed with instructions patients who are secluded due to aggressive behaviour should not be restrained to seclusion nor medication to calm them instead restraint measures should be taken into consideration other measures such as behavioural therapy should be considered when assessing the care of the patient seclusion must only be used in the best interest of the patient it must only be used as a last resort method and it must not be prolonged as a form of punishment on the patient in ireland the mental health commission governs seclusion in psychiatric institutions the act states that people can only be placed in seclusion if it prevents them from hurting themselves and or others and it complies with seclusion people can go into voluntary seclusion to enjoy peace and quiet and possibly to pray in the film the sound of music the character maria went into seclusion to pray when she came back to the abbey because she needed time alone after the baroness told her that captain von trapp was in love with maria and maria was going to be a nun infobox aircraft begin infobox aircraft type the mb 81 was a french military aircraft built by socit des avions marcel bloch as a flying ambulance since it was designed to carry one passenger in or out of a stretcher developed in response to a government sponsored competition in support of the new doctrine of aerial first aid it was employed exclusively in the overseas colonies specifically morocco and syria unlike the mb 80 prototype the mb 81 had a closed cockpit and a somewhat larger cargo space this was the company s first design which made it out of prototyping history the aircraft was designed to be able to seek patients or casualties by scouting even at high altitudes during military operations in mountainous countries like then french morocco over the atlas mountains the main design feature made it possible to transport a casualty lying prone in a compartment placed between the pilot and the engine the wings could also be adapted to hold casualties remaining constantly under the sight of the pilot and connected to him first flight at the beginning of summer 1932 in villacoublay piloted by zacharie heu an all metal monoplane with low wings it was equipped with a french lorraine 5 pc of 88 24 kw 120 hp which allowed him to reach a speed of 190 km h 119 hp at an altitude of 6 400 meters 21 000 ft it was able to take off in 70 meters 230 ft and to land in 95 meters 312 ft in a 1932 test the mb 80 carried out 209 landings in one and a half days without any problems the aircraft was built without any assistance from the government but an initial order of 20 was placed by the ground french forces the french arme de l air was founded in 1933 and it was one of the aircraft that relaunched marcel bloch in the aeronautical construction industry the production model called the mb 81 was fitted with a french salmson 9nd of 128 68 kw 175 hp it took part in military operations 1930s the mb 81 entered service in 1935 and was used extensively throughout north africa and the middle east a few were used in 1939 1940 before the french

complete hearing loss to his right ear when mortar landed near his foxhole during combat in served for over 26 years from 1984 1995 reyes served as the sector chief for the mcallen and el paso sectors of the border patrol in 1993 while serving as the chief patrol agent of the el paso border patrol sector reyes led the border patrol to strategically position agents on the border to intercept undocumented immigrants in a strategy later termed operation hold the line this operation was the predecessor to a similar operation dubbed operation gatekeeper in southern california such tactics were not without controversy as placing border patrol agents in high visibility positions placed them at tremendous risk from rock and firearms assaults from the mexican side of the border immigrant rights groups also protested the strategy as it was effective in deterring undocumented aliens from crossing in protected urban areas such as el paso and san diego california and as such forced them to cross through desolate parts of the southern united states such as the deserts of the imperial valley in california and the sonora desert in arizona reyes gained enormous popularity in the reducing

december 1 2006 reyes was tapped by pelosi the prospective speaker of the house to be the new chairman of the house intelligence committee reyes was a key player in the 109th congress because of his immigration and border patrol experience he was instrumental in leading the opposition to the house immigration proposal proposed by james sensenbrenner h r 4437 congresswoman nancy pelosi selected reyes to present and lead the debate on a democratic substitute to replace the sensenbrenner legislation which was voted down on a party line vote reyes has served as chairman of the congressional

lead a high level congressional delegation to meet with president felipe calderon of mexico reyes led the delegation and was accompanied by ike skelton chairman of the house armed services committee and howard berman chairman of the house foreign affairs committee the three high ranking chairman discussed mexico s efforts to combat drug related violence and assessed u s efforts to assist the mexican government in his role as chairman of the house intelligence committee reyes was a deciding factor in whether legislation on the floor of the house extending provisions of the fisa would include retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies which participated in the nsa s warrantless wiretap program although he initially supported immunity for telecommunications companies saying that immunity was necessary and the companies had n t done anything illegal eventually after being contacted by pressure groups the version of the legislation he introduced did not contain provisions for that did not contain telecom immunity in a december 2006 interview with congressional quarterly reyes said that al qaeda an exclusively sunni group was composed of both sunni and shi te members he then instead asserted al qaeda is predominantly probably shi ite he also avoided answering the question whether hezbollah a shi ite organization was sunni or shi ite in the same interview reyes said he favored sending more troops to iraq on a temporary basis im willing to ramp them up by twenty or thirty thousand for i do nt know two months four months six months but certainly that would be an exception yet a month later when president george w bush proposed sending approximately 21 500 more troops reyes said to the el paso times we do n t have the capability to escalate even to

properties possibly through its interaction with protein 4 1 moreover it has previously been shown that membranes deficient in protein 4 1 exhibit decreased content of glycophorin c it is also an integral membrane protein of the erythrocyte and acts as the receptor for the plasmodium falciparum protein pfebp 2 erythrocyte binding protein 2 baebl eba 140 history the antigen was discovered in 1960 when three women who lacked the antigen made anti gea in response to pregnancy the antigen is named after one of the patients a mrs gerbich the following year a new but related antigen was discovered in a mrs yus for whom an antigen in this system is also named in 1972 a numerical system for the antigens in this blood group was introduced genomics despite the similar names glycophorin c and d are unrelated to the other three glycophorins latter proteins are closely related glycophorin a and glycophorin b carry the blood group mn and ss antigens respectively there are 225 000 molecules of gpc and gpd per erythrocyte originally it was thought that glycophorin c and d were the result of a gene duplication event but it was only later realised that that they were encoded by the same gene glycophorin d gpd is generated from the glycophorin c messenger rna by leaky translation at an in frame aug at codon 30 glycophorin d glycophorin c residues 30 to 128 this leaky translation appears to be a uniquely human trait glycophorin c gpc is a single polypeptide chain of 128 amino acids and is encoded by a gene on the long arm of chromosome 2 2q14 q21 the gene was first cloned in 1989 by high et al the gpc gene is organized in four exons distributed over 13 5 kilobase pairs of dna exon 1 encodes residues 1 16 exon 2 residues 17 35 exon 3 residues 36 63 and highly homologous with less than 5 nucleotide divergence these exons also differ by a 9 amino acid insert at the 3 end of exon 3 the direct repeated segments containing these exons is 3 4 kilobase pairs long and may be derived from a recent duplication of a single ancestral domain exons 1 2 and most of exon 3 encode the n terminal extracellular domain while the remainder of exon 3 and exon 4 encode transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains two isoforms are known and the gene is expressed in a wide variety of tissues including kidney thymus stomach breast adult liver and erythrocyte in the non erythroid cell lines expression is lower than in the erythrocyte and the protein is differentially glycosylated in the erythrocyte glycophorin c makes up 4 of the membrane sialoglycoproteins the average number of o linked chains is 12 per molecule the gene is expressed early in the development of the erythrocyte specifically in the erythroid burst forming unit and erythroid colony forming unit the mrna from human erythroblasts is 1 4 kilobases long mapped to 1050 base pairs 5 of the start codon it is expressed early in developlment and before the kell antigens rhesus associated glycoprotein glycophorin a band 3 the rhesus antigen and glycophorin b in melanocytic cells glycophorin c gene expression may be regulated by mitf gpc appears to be synthesized in excess in the erythrocyte and that the membrane content is regulated by band 4 1 protein 4 1 additional data on the regulation of glycophorin c is in a study of this gene among the hominoidea two finding unique to humans emerged 1 an excess of non synonymous divergence among species that appears to be caused solely by accelerated evolution and 2 the ability of the single gypc gene to encode both the gpc and gpd proteins the cause for this is not known but it was suggested that these findings might be the result of infection by plasmodium falciparum molecular biology after separation of red cell membranes by sds polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with periodic acid schiff staining been named glycophorin a b c and d in order of the quantity present in the membrane glycophorin a being the most and glycophorin d the least common a fifth glycophorin e has been identified within the human genome but can not easily be detected on routine gel staining in total the glycophorins constitute 2 of the total erythrocyte membrane protein mass confusingly these proteins are also known under different nomenclatures but they are probably best known as the glycophorins glycophorin c was first isolated in 1978 glycophorin c and d are minor sialoglycoproteins contributing to 4 and 1 to the pas positive material and are present at about 2 0 and 0 5 x 10 sup 5 sup copies cell respectively in polyacrylimide gels glycophorin c s apparent weight is 32 kilodaltons 32 kda its structure is similar to that of other glycophorins a highly glycoslated extracellular domain residues 1 58 a transmembrane domain residues 59 81 and an intracellular domain residues 82 128 about 90 of the glycophorin c present in the erythrocyte is within the membrane glycophorin d s apparent molecular weight is 23kda on average this protein has 6 o linked oligosaccarides per molecule within the erythrocyte it interacts with band 4 1 an 80 kda protein and p55 a palmitoylated peripheral membrane phosphoprotein and a member of the membrane associated guanylate kinase family to form a ternary complex that is critical for the shape and stability of erythrocytes the major attachment sites between the erythrocyte spectrin actin cytoskeleton and the lipid bilayer are glycophorin c and band 3 the interaction with band 4 1 and p55 is mediated by the n terminal 30 kd domain of band 4 1 binding to a 16 amino acid segment residues 82 98 residues 61 77 of glycophorin d within the cytoplasmic domain of glycophorin c and to a positively charged 39 amino acid motif in p55 the majority of protein 4 1 is bound to glycophorin c the magnitude of the strength of the interaction between glycophorin c and band 4 1 has been estimated to be 6 9 micronewtons per meter a figure typical of protein amp ndash protein interactions glycophorin this is reduced in southeast asian ovalocytosis a disease of erythrocytes due to a mutation in band 3 transfusion medicine these glycophorins are associated with

antigens there are four alleles ge 1 to ge 4 three types of ge antigen negativity are known ge 1 2 3 leach phenotype ge 2 3 and ge 2 3 a 3 4 because of unequal crossing over between the two repeated domains is responsible for the formation of the ge 2 3 genotype the breakpoints of the deletion are located within introns 2 and 3 and results in the deletion of exon 3 this mutant gene is transcribed as a messenger rna with a continuous open reading frame extending over 300 nucleotides and is translated into the sialoglycoprotein found on ge 2 3 red cells a second 3 4 kilobase pair deletion within the glycophorin c gene eliminates only exon 2 by a similar mechanism and generates the mutant gene encoding for the abnormal glycoprotein found on ge 2 3 erythrocytes the ge2 epitope is antigenic only on glycophorin d and is a cryptic antigen in glycophorin c it is located within exon 2 and is sensitive to trypsin and papain but resistant to chymotrypsin and pronase the ge3 epitope is encoded by exon 3 it is sensitive to trypsin but resistant to chymotrypsin papain and pronase it is thought to lie in the between amino acids 42 50 in glycophorin c residues 21 49 in 21 amino acids of glycophorin c it is sensitive to trypsin papain pronase and neuraminidase leach antigen the relatively rare leach phenotype is due either to a deletion in exons 3 and 4 or to a frameshift mutation causing a premature stop codon in the glycophorin c gene and persons with this phenotype are less susceptible 60 of the control rate to invasion by plasmodium falciparum such individuals have a subtype of a condition called hereditary elliptocytosis the abnormally shaped cells are known as elliptocytes or cameloid cells the basis for this phenotype was first reported by telen et al the phenotype is ge 2 3 4 yussef antigen the yussef yus phenotype is due to a 57 base pair deletion corresponding to exon 2 the antigen is known as gpc yus glycophorin c mutations are rare in most of the western world but are more common in some places where malaria is endemic in melanesia a greater percentage of any other part of the world the incidence of gerbich negative phenotype caused by an exon 3 deletion in the wosera east sepik province and liksul madang province populations of papua new guinea is 0 463 and 0 176 respectively webb antigen the rare webb wb antigen 1 1000 donors originally described in 1963 in australia is the result of an alteration in glycosylation of glycophorin c an a to g transition at nucleotide 23 results in an asparagine residue instead of the normal serine residue with the resultant loss of glycoslation the antigen is known as gpc wb duch antigen the rare duch dh antigen was discovered in aarhus denmark 1968 and is also found on glycophorin c it is due to a c to t transition at nucleotide 40 resulting in the replacement of leucine by phenylalanine this antigen is sensitive to trypsin but resistant to chymotrypsin and endo f lewis antigen the lewis ii ls a ge 6 antigen has insert of 84 nucleotides into entire sequence of exon 3 two subtypes of this antigen are known beta ls a which carries the ge3 epitope and gamma ls a which carries both the ge2 and ge3 epitopes this antigen is also known as the rs a antigen ahonen antigen the ahonen ana antigen was first reported in 1972 the antigen is found on glycophorin d this antigen was discovered in a finnish man on may 5 1968 during post operative blood cross matching for an aortic aneurism repair in finland the incidence of this antigen was found to be 6 10 000 donors in sweden the incidence was 2 3266 donors the molecular basis for the origin of this antigen lies within exon 2 where a g t substitution in codon 67 base position 199 converts an alanine to a serine residue while this epitope exists within glycophorin c there it is a cryptanitgen it is only antigenic in glycophorin d because of the truncated n terminus others a duplicated exon 2 has erythrocytes also been reported in japanese blood donors 2 10 000 new anitgen antibodies antibodies to the gerbich antigens have been associated with transfusion reactions and mild hemolytic disease of the newborn in other studies naturally occurring anti ge antibodies have been found and appear to be of no clinical significance immunological tolerance towards ge antigen has been suggested other areas high expression of glycophorin c has been associated with a poor prognosis for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in the chinese glycophorin c is the receptor for the protein erythrocyte binding antigen 140 eba140 of plasmodium falciparum this interaction mediates a principal invasion pathway into the erythrocytes the partial resistance of erythocytes lacking this protein to invasion by p falciparum was first noted in 1982 the lack of gerbich antigens in the population of papua new guinea was noted in 1989 influenza a and b bind to glycophorin c references kim ki hoon born july 14 1967 is a retired short

moon it lies to the southwest of the crater cavendish and south of mersenius the rim of de gasparis is worn and eroded and the interior has been flooded by basaltic lava the surviving outer rim reaches a maximum altitude of about 0 8 km this crater is notable for the formation of rilles that criss cross the floor and the surrounding surface this system of clefts in the surface is designated rimae de gasparis and they span an area of about 130 kilometers in diameter the rilles are thought to have been created due to tectonic faults deep below the surface as they cut across de gasparis this indicates that they were formed after the crater satellite craters by convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest eboracum was a fort and city in roman britain the settlement evolved into york located in north yorkshire england etymology the first known recorded mention of eboracum by name is dated circa 95104 ad and is an address containing the latin form of the settlement s name eburaci on a wooden stylus tablet from the roman fortress of vindolanda in what is now the modern northumberland during the roman period the name was also written in the form eboracum and eburacum the etymology of eboracum is uncertain as the language of the indigenous population of the area was never recorded however the generally accepted view of british history is that the inhabitants of britain at this time spoke a celtic language related to modern welsh this language has been reconstructed from latin place names and modern celtic languages and has been called by scholars common brythonic the name eboracum is thought to have derived from means place of the yew trees the word for yew was probably something like ibura in celtic cf old irish ibar yew tree alder buckthorn alder buckthorn combined with the suffix ko n place cf welsh og meaning place of the yew trees cf efrog in welsh eabhrach iubhrach in irish gaelic and eabhrach iobhrach in scottish gaelic by which names the city is known in those languages the name is then thought to have been latinized by replacing acon with acum

1199 vry essonne origins the roman conquest of britain began in 43 ad but advance beyond the humber did not take place until the early 70s ad this was because the people in the area known as the brigantes by the romans became a roman client state when their leadership changed becoming more hostile to rome roman general quintus petillius cerialis led the ninth legion north from lincoln across the humber eboracum was founded in 71 ad when cerialis and the ninth legion constructed a military fortress castra on flat ground above the river ouse near its junction with the river foss in the same year cerialis was appointed governor of britain a legion at full strength at that time numbered some 5 500 men and provided new trading opportunities for enterprising local people who doubtless flocked to eboracum to take advantage of them as a result permanent civilian settlement grew up around the fortress especially on its south east side civilians also settled on the opposite side of the ouse initially along the main road from eboracum to the south west streets were laid out public buildings were erected and private houses spread out over terraces on the steep slopes above the river military fortress from its foundation the roman fort of eboracum was aligned on a north east south east bearing on the north bank of the river ouse it measured 1600 pes monetalis 473 6m by 1360 pes monetalis 402 56m and covered an area of 50 acre the standard suit of streets running through the castra is assumed although some evidence exists for the via praetoria via decumana and via sagularis much of the modern understanding of the fortress defences has come from extensive excavations undertake by leslie peter wenham the layout of the fortress also followed the standard for a legionary fortress with wooden buildings inside a square defensive boundary these defences originally consisting of turf ramparts on a green wood foundation were built by the ninth legion between 71 and 74 ad turf front on a new oak foundation and eventually wooden battlements were added which were then replaced by limestone walls and towers the original wooden camp was refurbished by agricola in 81 before being completely rebuilt in stone between 107 and 108 multiple phases of restructuring and rebuilding within the fortress are recorded rebuilding in stone began in the early second century ad under trajan but may have taken as long as the start of the reign of septimius severus to be completed a period of over 100 years estimates suggest that over 48000m sup 3 sup of stone were required largely consisting of magnesian limestone from the quarries nearby the roman settlement of calcaria tadcaster emperors there is evidence that the emperor hadrian visited in 122 on his way north to plan his great walled frontier he certainly brought with him the sixth legion to replace the existing garrison emperor septimius severus visited eboracum in 208 and made it his base for campaigning in scotland the fortress wall was probably reconstructed during his see this work standing almost to full height the imperial court was based in york until at least ad211 in which year severus died and was succeeded by his sons caracalla and geta in the later 3rd century the western empire experienced political and economic turmoil and britain was for some time ruled by usurpers independent of rome it was after crushing the last of these that emperor constantius i came to eboracum and in 306 became the second emperor to die there his son constantine was instantly proclaimed as successor by the troops based in the fortress although it took constantine eighteen years to become sole ruler of the empire he may have retained an interest in eboracum and the reconstruction of the south west front of the fortress with polygonally fronted interval towers and the two great corner towers one of which the multangular tower still survives is probably his work in the colonia constantine s reign was a time of prosperity and a number of extensive stone town houses of the romans eboracum was the major military base in the north of britain and following the 3rd century division of the province of britannia the capital of northern britain britannia inferior by 237 eboracum had been made a colonia the highest legal status a roman city could attain one of only four in britain and the others were founded for retired soldiers this mark of imperial favour was probably a recognition of eboracum as the largest town in the north and the capital of britannia inferior at around the same time eboracum became self governing with a council made up of rich locals including merchants and veteran soldiers in 296 britannia inferior was divided into two provinces of equal status with eboracum becoming the provincial capital of britannia secunda culture as a busy port and a provincial capital eboracum was a cosmopolitan city with residents from throughout the roman empire diet substantial evidence for the use of cereal crops and animal husbandry can be found in eboracum on the north bank of the ouse and outside the fortress showed that spelt wheat was the most common cereal grain used at that time followed by barley cattle sheep goat and pig are the major sources of meat hunting scenes as shown through romano british hunt cups suggest that hunting is a popular pastime and diet would be supplemented through the hunting of hare deer and boar a variety of food preparation vessels mortaria have been excavated from the city and large millstones used in the processing of cereals have been found in rural sites outside the colonia at heslington and stamford bridge in terms of the ceremonial use of food dining scenes are used on tombstones to represent an aspirational image of the deceased in the afterlife reclining on a couch and being served food and wine the tombstones of julia velva mantinia maercia and aelia aeliana each depict a dining scene additionally several inhumation burials from trentholme drive contained hen s eggs placed in ceramic urns as grave goods for of roman religious beliefs among the people of eboracum have been found including altars to mars hercules jupiter and fortune in terms of number of references the most popular deities were the spiritual representation genius of eboracum and the mother goddess there is also evidence of local and regional deities evidence showing the worship of eastern deities has also been found during excavations in york for example evidence of the mithras cult which was popular among the military has been found including a sculpture showing mithras slaying a bull and a dedication to arimanius the god of evil in the mithraic tradition the mithraic relief located in mickelgate suggests the location of a temple to mithras right in the heart of the colonia another example is the dedication of a temple to serapis a hellenistic egyptian god by the commander of the sixth legion other known deities from the city include tethys veteris venus silvanus toutatis chnoubis and the imperial numen there unknown when this was first formed and in archaeological terms there is virtually no record of it the first evidence of this community is a document noting the attendance of bishop eborius of eboracum at the council of arles in 314 the episcopal see at eboracum was called eboracensis in latin and bishops from the see also attended the first council of nicaea in 325 the council of sardica and the council of ariminum death and burial the cemeteries of roman york follow the major roman roads out of the settlement excavations in the castle yard next to clifford s tower beneath the railway station at trentholme drive and the mount have located significant evident for human remains using both inhumation and cremation burial rites the cemetery beneath the railway station was subject to excavations in advance of railway works of 183941 1845 and 18707 several sarcophagi were unearthed during this phase of excavations including those of flavius bellator and julia fortunata inhumation burial in sarcophagi can often include the body variations on this combination exist the gypsum casts when found undisturbed frequently retain a cast impression of the deceased in a textile shroud surviving examples of both adults and children show a selection of textiles used to wrap the body before interment but usually plain woven cloth the high number of sarcophagi from eboracum has provided a large number of these casts in some cases with cloth surviving adhered to the gypsum comparable cemetery sites in roman britain have provided evidence of the use of organic resins made from pine cones being used to seal the cloth shroud an excavation in advance of building work underneath the yorkshire museum in 2009 located a male skeleton with significant pathology to suggest that he may have died as a gladiator in eboracum the emperor septimius severus was cremated in eboracum following his death in ad211 the roman biographer cassius dio records the event and described a scene in which the emperor utters the final words to his two sons on his death bed agree with each other severus was cremated somewhere outside the fortress wall and again cassius dio paints a picture his body arrayed in military garb was placed upon a pyre and as a mark of honour the soldiers and his sons ran about it and as for the soldier s gifts those who had things at hand to offer them put them upon it and his sons applied the fire a hill to the west of the city named severus hill is associated by some antiquarians as the site where this cremation took place but no modern archaeological investigation has so far correlated this claim economy the military presence at eboracum was the driving force behind early developments in its economy in these early stages eboracum operated as a command economy with workshops growing up outside the fortress to supply the needs of the 5000 troops garrisoned there production included military pottery until the mid 3rd century military tile kilns have been found in the aldwark peasholme green area glassworking at coppergate metalworks and leatherworks producing military eboracum was the major manufacturing centre for whitby jet known as gagates in latin it was used from the early 3rd century as material for jewelry and was exported from here throughout britain and into europe examples found in york take the form of rings bracelets necklaces and pendants depicting married couples and the medusa there are fewer than 25 jet pendants in the roman world of which six are known from eboracum these are housed in the yorkshire museum roads the true paths of all original roman roads leading out of eboracum are not known although eleven have been suggested the known roads include dere street leading north west from the city through clifton towards the site of cataractonium modern catterick cade s road towards petuaria modern brough and ermine street towards lindum modern lincoln a road bypassing the south wall wall of the fortress between the fortress and the river is conjectured to run beneath the york museum gardens rivers the river ouse and river foss provided important access points for the importation of heavy goods the existence of two possible wharves on the east bank of the river foss support this idea a large deposit of grain in a timber structure beneath modern day coney street on the north east bank of the river ouse suggests the existence of storehouses for moving goods via the river late roman york the decline of roman britain in early fifth century ad led to significant social and economic changes all over britain whilst the latest datable inscription referencing eboracum dates from ad237 the continuation of the settlement after this time is certain building work in the city continued in the fourth century under constantine and later count theodosius the locally produced crambeck ware pottery arrives in eboracum in the fourth century the most famous form being intricately decorated buff yellow parchment ware painted with bright shades of red the effect of in roman britain a bishop of york named eborius is attested here and several artifacts decorated with chi rho symbols are known additionally a small bone plaque from an inhumation grave bore the phrase soror ave vivas in deo hail sister may you live in god changes in the layout of both the fort and colonia occurred in the late fourth century ad suggested as representing a social change in the domestic lives of the military garrison here whereby they may be living in smaller family groups with wives children or other civilians rediscovery of roman york the rediscovery and modern understanding of eboracum began in the 17th century several prominent figures have been involved in this process martin lister was the first to recognise that the multangular tower was roman in date in a 1683 paper with the royal society john horsley s 1732 britannia romana or the roman antiquities of britain included a chapter on roman york eboracum the first book of its kind on roman york drake also published accounts in the philosophical transactions of the royal society the rev charles wellbeloved was one of the founders of the yorkshire philosophical society and a curator of the antiquities in the yorkshire museum until his death in 1858 he published a systematic account of roman york titled eboracum or york under the romans in 1842 including first hand records of discoveries during excavations in 1835 william hargrove brought many new discoveries to the attention of the public through published articles in his newspaper the herald and the courant and published a series of guides with references to casual finds the first large scale excavations were undertaken by s miller from glasgow university in the 1920s with a focus on the defences archaeological remains substantial physical remains have been

basic theme on pink floyd s 1979 rock opera the wall subtitled part 1 working title reminiscing part 2 working title education and part 3 working title drugs all parts were written by pink floyd s bassist roger waters part ii is a protest song against rigid schooling in general and boarding schools in the uk in particular it was also released as a single and provided the band s only number one hit in the united kingdom the united states west germany and many other countries in addition in the us along with the tracks run like hell and do n t leave me now another brick in the wall reached number fifty seven on the disco chart in the uk it was pink floyd s first single since 1968 s point me at the sky the song was also the final number one floyd received a grammy nomination for best performance by a rock duo or group and lost to bob seger s against the wind in addition part ii was number 375 on rolling stone s list of the 500 greatest songs of all time the single sold over 4 million copies worldwide the single as well as the album the wall were banned in south africa in 1980 after the song was adopted by supporters of a nationwide school boycott protesting racial inequities in education under the apartheid regime concept each of the three parts has a similar tune and lyrical structure though not lyrics aside from the all in all refrain and each is louder and more enraged than the one before rising from the sadness of part i to the protesting part ii to the furious part iii part 1 composition part 1 of the song is very quiet dynamically and features a long subdued guitar solo parts 2 and 3 although there is a short sharp rise in dynamics and tone for a brief period towards the end of the lyrical portion sniffing shouting wailing calling and children can be faintly heard in the background the song s beginning coincides with the final chord of the thin ice and the echoing multi guitar solo after the lyrics crossfades into the helicopter and yelling teacher sounds of the happiest days of our lives plot the thin ice discussed during the previous song breaks when pink becomes older and learns of the death of his father pink is devastated by this reality and begins to build the wall film version pink s mother is seen praying in a church after the death of her husband overseas pink however is at this point oblivious of his death and can be seen playing with a toy aeroplane the song continues with pink playing in a public park after his mother leaves him to go shopping he sees a man his own father the man gives pink a lift onto a ride and it s clear pink feels as if this man is his real father pink follows the man s son around copying him but does n t understand why the other boy s father is n t paying attention to him he grabs the man s hand but is shooed away only to grab the man s hand again the man pushes pink away again and dejectedly he sits on a swing which is too far off the ground for him to swing himself he looks over at the other parents swinging their kids feeling even more alone part 2 composition in the album version of the wall another brick in the wall part 2 segues from the happiest days of our lives with roger waters signature scream the song has strong drums a well known bass line and distinctive guitar parts in the background with a smooth yet of schoolchildren singing in the second verse as the song ends the sounds of a school yard are heard along with a scots teacher who continues to lord it over the children s lives by shouting wrong do it again and if you do n t eat yer meat you ca n t have any pudding how can you have any pudding if you do n t eat yer meat and you yes you behind the bikesheds stand still laddie all of it dissolving into the dull drone of a phone ringing and ending with a deep sigh school choir producer bob ezrin had immediately recognised the hit potential of this song but it took some manoeuvring behind the band s back until part ii took its eventual form it was ezrin s idea to use a school choir for this song as he explained to guitar world in 2009 the most important thing i did for the song was to insist that long which it was when roger wrote it when we played it with the disco drumbeat i said man this is a hit but it s one minute 20 we need two verses and two choruses and they said well you re not bloody getting them we do n t do singles so fuck you so i said okay fine and they left and because of our two tape recorder set up while they were n t around we were able to copy the first verse and chorus take one of the drum fills put them in between and extend the chorus then the question is what do you do with the second verse which is the same and having been the guy who made alice cooper s school s out album griffiths approached music teacher alun renshaw of islington green school around the corner from pink floyd s britannia row studios about the choir though the school received a lump sum payment of 1000 sales under a 1996 uk copyright law they became eligible for royalties from broadcasts and after royalties agent peter rowan traced choir members through the website friends reunited and other means they lodged a claim for royalties with the performing artists media rights association in 2004 disco beat the idea for the disco beat came likewise from ezrin as david gilmour explained in 2009 of the final outcome roger waters has commented david gilmour said plot after being insulted by the teacher pink dreams that the kids in his school begin to protest against their abusive teachers the song talks about how he had a personal wall around him from the rest of the world the teachers were just another brick in the wall film version following the happiest days of our lives pink starts to daydream during his class he imagines several students marching in unison to the beat of the song following a path until they enter a steamy tunnel section to re emerge as putty faced clones void of individual starting with gilmour s guitar solo the children destroy the school building using hammers foreshadowing the subsequent neo fascist nazi like animated sequence with its marching hammers and crowbars creating a bonfire dragging their teacher out of the burning school kicking and screaming while chanting we do n t need no education the song ends with pink rubbing his hand which the teacher slapped with a ruler in the song previously during the song the teacher s meat and pudding lines are folded into the first few lines of the school choir s lines with the instrumental breaks between shortened by a bar in 2 places and are performed by the teacher in the film played by alex mcavoy music video prior to the film the first video for the track directed by album concert film art designer gerald scarfe depicted students running in a playground kings square gardens islington and the teacher puppet from the wall concerts was used the video also mixed in some animated scenes later the opening shot a pan across the london skyline was filmed from the top of turnpike house in islington both st lukes church and st clements church the one overlooking the playground are both clearly visible in the shot after the media furore surrounding the song the islington green school head teacher margaret maden refused permission for the children who sang on the song to appear in the video or on top of the pops although at the time they were told it was because they did n t hold equity cards once the film was completed the actual scenes of the happiest days of our lives and another brick in the wall part ii were combined into a new video which now represents the music video for another brick in the wall live versions when performed as part of the various live shows of the wall the teacher is represented by a

term lordosis refers to the normal inward curvature of the lumbar and cervical regions of the spine excessive or hyperlordosis can happen and lumbar hyperlordosis is commonly referred to as swayback or saddle back a term that originates from the similar condition that arises in some horses this condition can commonly affect dancers a major factor of lordosis is forward pelvic tilt when the pelvis tips forward when resting on top of the thighs curvature in the opposite direction is termed kyphosis cause normal lordotic curvatures also known as secondary curvatures results in a difference in the thickness between the front and back parts of the intervertebral disc lordosis may also increase at puberty sometimes not becoming evident until the early or mid 20s imbalances in muscle strength and length are also a cause such as weak hamstrings or tight hip flexors psoas other health conditions and disorders can cause lordosis achondroplasia a disorder where bones grow abnormally which can result in condition in which vertebrae slip forward and osteoporosis the most common bone disease in which bone density is lost resulting in bone weakness and increased likelihood of fracture are some of the most common causes of lordosis other causes include obesity kyphosis spine curvature disorder in which the thoracic curvature is abnormally rounded discitits an inflammation of the intervertebral disc space caused by infection and benign juvenile lordosis excessive lordotic curvature is also called hyperlordosis hollow back saddle back and swayback common causes of excessive lordosis include tight low back muscles excessive visceral fat and pregnancy although lordosis gives an impression of a stronger back incongruently it can lead to moderate to severe lower back pain rickets a vitamin d deficiency in children can cause lumbar lordosis diagnosis measurement and diagnosis of lumbar lordosis can be difficult obliteration of vertebral end plate landmarks by interbody fusion may make the traditional measurement of segmental lumbar lordosis more difficult because the l4 l5 and l5 s1 levels are most commonly to normal lumbar lordosis it is helpful to identify a reproducible and accurate means of measuring segmental lordosis at these levels a visible sign of lordosis is an abnormally large arch of the lower back and the person appears to be puffing out his or her stomach and buttocks precise diagnosis of lordosis is done by looking at a complete medical history physical examination and other tests of the patient x rays are used to measure the lumbar curvature bone scans are conducted in order to rule out possible fractures and infections magnetic resonance imaging mri is used to eliminate the possibility of spinal cord or nerve abnormalities and computed tomography scans ct scans are used to get a more detailed image of the bones muscles and organs of the lumbar region treatment lumbar lordosis may be treated by strengthening the hip extensors on the back of the thighs and by stretching the hip flexors on the front of the thighs only the muscles on the front and on the back of the thighs standing position because they can discharge the force on the ground through the legs and feet abdominal muscles and erector spinae ca n t discharge force on an anchor point while standing unless one is holding his hands somewhere hence their function will be to flex or extend the torso not the hip back hyper extensions on a roman chair or inflatable ball will strengthen all the posterior chain and will treat lordosis so too will stiff legged deadlifts and supine hip lifts and any other similar movement strengthening the posterior chain without involving the hip flexors in the front of the thighs abdominal exercises could be avoided altogether if they stimulate too much the psoas and the other hip flexors strengthening of the hip extensors which are on the back of the thighs and optionally stretching of the hip flexors which are on the front of the thighs will be enough to treat a lordosis in quite a short time anti inflammatory pain relievers may be taken as directed for short term relief physical therapy effectively kyphosis lordosis and bad posture hypo lordosis is more common than hyper lordosis hypo lordosis can be corrected non surgically through rehabilitation exercises many different techniques exist to accomplish this correction these exercises if done correctly may reduce symptoms in those with the typical presentation in 3 6 months this type of treatment is typically provided by a chiropractor though some physical therapists offer it as well controversy regarding the degree to which manipulative therapy can help a patient still exists if therapeutic measures reduce symptoms but not the measurable degree of lordotic curvature this could be viewed as a successful outcome of treatment though based solely on subjective data the presence of measurable abnormality does not automatically equate with a level of reported symptoms in animals lordosis can be also seen in animals in particular horses and other equines usually called swayback soft back or low back it is an undesirable conformation trait swayback is caused in part from a loss of muscle tone in both the back and abdominal as in humans it may be influenced by bearing young it is sometimes seen in a broodmare that has had multiple foals however it is also common in older horses whose age leads to loss of muscle tone and stretched ligaments it also occurs due to overuse or injury to the muscles and ligaments from excess work or loads or from premature work placed upon an immature animal equines with too long a back are more prone to the condition than those with a short back but as a longer back is also linked to smoother gaits the trait is sometimes encouraged by selective breeding it has been found to have a hereditary basis in the american saddlebred breed transmitted via a recessive mode of inheritance research into the genetics underlying the condition has several values beyond just the saddlebred breed as it may serve as a model for investigating congenital skeletal deformities in horses and other species other lordosis behavior refers to the position that some mammalian females including cats mice in heat the term is also used to describe mounting behavior in mammalian males in radiology a lordotic view is an x ray taken of a patient leaning backwards lordosis in the human spine makes it easier for humans to bring the bulk of their mass over the pelvis this allows for a much more efficient walking gait than that of other primates whose inflexible spines cause them to resort to an inefficient forward leaning bent knee bent waist gait as such lordosis in the human spine is considered one of the primary physiological adaptations of the human skeleton that allows for human gait to be as energetically efficient as it is calypso is a song written by john denver in 1975 as a tribute to jacques yves cousteau and his research ship the calypso the song was featured on denver s 1975 album windsong released as the b side of i m sorry calypso received substantial airplay enabling it to chart on the billboard hot 100 after i m sorry fell out of the 1 position calypso began receiving more airplay than i m sorry thus causing billboard to list calypso as the new a side hence calypso is itself considered a 2 hit on the hot 100 john denver was a close friend of jacques yves cousteau calypso was the name of jacques cousteau s research boat that sailed around the world for ocean conservation cultural references a filk song exists in star trek fandom and has been quoted in chapter 8 of diane duane s star trek novel the s calypso but adapted to the

callisto referring to a sexual desire for callisto originally a villainess in the tv show xena warrior princess and then one of xena s enemies after callisto was redeemed in the xena stories he wrote

unconventional voice over narration e g lars von trier s europa 1991 nationality iranian mohammad ali jamlzdeh esfahani january 13 1892 isfahan iran november 8 1997 geneva switzerland was one of the most prominent writers of iran in the 20th century best known for his unique style of humour in view of his vast influence over persian short story writing he is often referred to as the father of this genre in iran biography early years and family sayyed mohammad ali jamalzadeh the founder of the persian short story genre was born in esfahan into a middle class family the date of his birth is uncertain years between 1892 to 1896 have been mentioned and by the end of his life even he himself was not certain of the actual year the year 1895 has traditionally been taken as the year of his birth jamalzadeh s father sayyed jamal ad din esfahani was a progressive mullah and preacher who became a constitutional revolutionary delivering raging sermons which inspired his son but cost him his life mohammad ali shah qajar who considered him among the most dangerous of his enemies living abroad the young jamalzadeh lived in iran only until he was twelve or thirteen thereafter he lived in lebanon where he attended the aintoura catholic school 1908 near beirut in france 1910 and in switzerland where he studied law at university of lausanne and later at university of burgundy in dijon france after his father s death jamalzadeh s life took a turn for the worse but thanks to many supporting friends and to occasional paid teaching jobs he survived starvation by the time of world war i still in his early age he joined a group of iranian nationalists in berlin and in 1915 founded a newspaper rastakhiz for this group in baghdad during this time he also worked for the periodical kveh 1916 in 1917 he published his first book ganj e shaye gan the start of the 20th century ganj e shaye gan deals with iran s socio political and economic problems a major contribution which bridges the gap between literature and science in the same year he represented the nationalists at the world congress of socialists in stockholm his later years until 1931 when he settled in geneva and worked thereafter for the international labour organization were spent in temporary employments such as one at the iranian embassy in berlin during all these years jamalzadeh had very little contact with iran but that did not bar him from learning persian on his own drawing on his scant experiences gained at a young age he wrote about the lives of contemporary iranians his preoccupation with the use of language and his dickensian style of writing including repetitions piling up of adjectives and using popular phrases quickly remind the reader of jamalzadeh s background and of his sincere intentions however his physical distance from the scenes of the events described in his stories somewhat compromises the s major work yeki bud yeki nabud once upon a time published in 1921 in berlin did not reach iran until a year later and when it did it was not received favourably the public especially the clergy loathed jamalzadeh s portrayal of their country to the degree that copies of the book were burned in public squares a collection of six short stories yeki bud yeki nabud deals with the social and political conditions in iran around the start of the 20th century a subject that up to then had been outside the purview of writers and poets in general moreover interwoven with this is a considerable amount of militancy against western interference in iran and an open mockery of religious fanaticism jamalzadeh s simple and colloquial style combined with a measured humour enhanced the impact of his writings making his stories such as yeki bud yeki nabud and farsi shekar ast persian is case this hostile public reaction affected jamalzadeh to the degree that for the next twenty years he refrained from engaging in any literary activities he began writing again in the 1940s but by that time he had lost the dexterity that imparted conciseness novelty of form originality of ideas a biting sense of humor and a tight structure to his earlier stories tautologism a tendency toward using sage remarks making mystical and philosophical speculations and disregard for order became the hallmark of his later writings sahra ye mahshar armageddon 1947 talkh o shirin bitter and

of his works of this period lack his original unique persian style even though he is at times as biting and as veracious as in his earlier writings in addition to persian jamalzadeh was fluent in french german and arabic he translated many books from the latter languages into persian death jamalzadeh died at the age of 105 in geneva switzerland his tomb is located in the cemetery block number

species of the gerbil subfamily and is the usual gerbil species to be kept as a pet or experimental animal when it is known as the domesticated gerbil like the syrian or golden hamster it was first brought to the united states in 1954 by dr victor schwentker for use in research forty four pairs caught originally from mongolia and brought to england they were described as squirrel colors with long furry tails the mongolian gerbil is classed as a prohibited new organism under new zealand s hazardous substances and new organisms act 1996 preventing it from being imported into the country origin meriones unguiculatus evolved on the semideserts and steppes of mongolia there they developed long legs for jumping and running from predators teeth to deal with hard seeds and plant matter and water conservation techniques that allow them to survive use dry food or stores of fat to generate metabolic water mongolian gerbils do not have many natural enemies due to the harsh climate most predators are birds of prey or snakes mongolian gerbils are diurnal but return to their burrows for the coldest and hottest parts of the day habitat the species m unguiculatus came originally from mongolia its habitat there is mainly semideserts and steppes soil on the steppes is sandy and is covered with grasses herbs and shrubs the steppes have cool dry winters and hot summers the temperature can get up to 50 c but the average temperature for most of the year is around 20 c in the wild these gerbils live in groups generally consisting of one parental pair the most recent litter and a few older pups only the dominant female will produce pups but she will mate with multiple males while in estrus heat one group of gerbils generally ranges over 325 1550m2 acre a group deeper burrows with only one to three exits in their territory may exist these deeper burrows are used to escape from predators when they are too far from the central burrow a group s burrows often interconnect with other groups history the first known mention of gerbils came in 1866 by father armand david who sent yellow rats to the museum of natural history muse d histoire naturelle in paris from northern china they were named meriones unguiculatus by the scientist milne edwards in 1867 this scientific name in a combination of greek and modified latin loosely translates as clawed warrior in english partly stemming from the greek warrior meriones in homer s iliad combined with unguiculate meaning to have claws or nails gerbils only became popular pets after 1954 when 20 breeding pairs were brought to the united states from eastern mongolia for scientific testing almost all pet gerbils today are descended from these 40 gerbils were brought to the gerbils as pets the mongolian gerbil a gentle and hardy animal has become a popular pet it was first brought from china to paris france in the 19th century and became a popular house pet it was then brought to the united states in 1954 by dr victor

tips and dark claws spotting dominant spotting can be in any coat variety and will lighten the fur around it how the spotting will look depends on modifiers collared a thick unbroken band of spotting around the neck connecting to the white belly collar and blaze a thick unbroken band of spotting around the neck connecting to the white belly and an unbroken white blaze connecting the three spotting areas neck forehead and nose pied the base coat color may be of any standard type except for white there is a thick band of white around the neck and shoulder area to form a collar that is connected to a blazed down the forehead and face the distinguishing feature are small spots on the rump and back area around the spinal area these spots usually do not have clear edges considered a mottled gerbil as long as the spotting pattern conforms to the standard accepted pattern mottled the coat color of the gerbil may be any standard coat color broken by small white patches accompanying a collar and blaze the gerbil may be up to 75 white until it would be considered a variegated gerbil variegated the variegated pattern is when any standard coat color is broken up by small white patches along with a collar and blaze the difference between the variegated spotting form and the mottled spotting form is the amount of white the variegated spotting is an extended form of mottling there is more white on the back and rump allowing less color to show through this can form a dalmatian pattern often the tail tuft and the end of the tail is white or lacking pigment extreme white the extreme white pattern is associated with any standard color except for white here the coat color is 90 white and barely any of the base coat color or concerns circulating about extreme white gerbils head tilts lack of good balance and repetitive running and circling has been reported in these gerbils it has been found that these health concerns mostly affect gerbils with unpigmented light pink not very opaque ears there are other spotting types any that do n t conform to show standards are usually classed as patched note although some us gerbil owners call some coat varieties fox i e yellow fox the fox gene is not in gerbils and this is therefore incorrect breeding though not much is known about breeding in wild mongolian gerbils we know that they can have as many as 18 pups compared to pet gerbils which can only have 14 the families make sure all young females in their groups leave before that can fall pregnant and kill the mothers newer pups whilst still in the family unit the father or older brothers will mate with younger females these young females have the ability to carry sperm for up to 2 weeks until they are can make a family of their own without the interference of another male who may kill the fathers pups this is why it is n t recommended to keep an older male gerbil with a younger female as a cage mate for a prolonged amount of time birthplace port macquarie australia robert

have protested against walmart the company s policies and business practices including charges of racial and gender discrimination other criticisms include foreign product sourcing treatment of product suppliers environmental practices the use of public subsidies and the company s security policies wal mart denies any wrongdoing and says that low prices are the result of efficiency in 2005 labor unions created new organizations and websites to criticize the company including wake up wal mart united food and commercial workers and walmart watch service employees international union by the end of 2005 walmart had launched working families for wal mart to counter those groups efforts to counter criticism include a public relations campaign in 2005 which included several television commercials the company retained the public relations firm edelman to interact with the press and respond to negative media reports and has started working with bloggers and inviting them to visit walmart s corporate headquarters in november 2005 a documentary film critical of walmart wal mart the high cost of low price was released on dvd economists at the cato institute say that walmart is successful because it sells products that consumers want at low prices satisfying customers wants and needs walmart s critics say that walmart s lower prices draw customers away from smaller main street businesses hurting local small town communities critics also say that walmart is hurting the u s economy because of excessive reliance on chinese products walmart is the largest importer in the u s in many categories such as electronics and fast moving consumer goods the 2006 book the wal mart effect by business journalist charles fishman contains much of the criticism though it also enumerates walmart s positive impacts within society local communities when walmart plans a new store location activists often oppose the new store and attempt to block its construction opponents cite concerns such as traffic congestion bad public relations low wages and benefits and predatory pricing opposition sometimes includes protest marches by competitors informed citizens activists labor unions and religious groups in some instances activists demonstrated their opposition by causing property damage to store buildings or by creating bomb scares some city councils have denied permits to developers planning to include a walmart in their project those who defend walmart cite consumer choice and overall benefits to the economy and object to bringing the issue into the political arena a walmart superstore opened in 2004 in mexico 1 9 miles from the historic teotihuacan archaeological site and pyramid of the moon although the location was supported by mexico s national anthropology institute the united nations and the paris based international council on monuments and sites there had been protests organized by local merchants as well as environmental groups and anti globalization groups who opposed the construction poet homero aridjis called the opening as supremely symbolic and like planting the staff of globalization in the heart of ancient mexico altar along with some other artifacts where the store s parking lot is now located in 1998 walmart proposed construction of a store west of the intersection of charlotte pike u s route 70 and interstate 40 outside nashville tennessee the building site was home to both native american burial grounds and a civil war battlefield protests were mounted by native americans and civil war interest groups but the walmart store was eventually constructed after moving graves and some modifications of the site so as not to interfere with the battlefield civil war relics were discovered at the site the project developers donated land to permit access to the civil war historic site the indian sites were removed and re buried elsewhere in 2005 developers demolished the long closed dixmont state hospital in kilbuck township pennsylvania near pittsburgh with plans to build a shopping complex anchored by a walmart while there were initially no general objections to the walmart store itself many residents did not want to see dixmont demolished despite the fact that the dixmont maintainable condition and teenagers were dangerously trespassing onto the property on a regular basis however while the land was being excavated after the hospital complex was torn down in order to create a plateau for the store to be built upon a landslide occurred covering pennsylvania route 65 and the fort wayne line railroad tracks between pa 65 and the ohio river both routes were shut down for weeks while walmart did stabilize the landslide many residents said that walmart merely stabilized the hillside so that it could continue with work to build the store ultimately in 2007 walmart decided against developing the site allowing the land to return to nature with a walmart location to be constructed in nearby economy pennsylvania instead next door to the northern lights shopping center and scheduled for a 2013 opening for some time pa 65 remained restricted to one lane northbound near the former dixmont site for safety concerns though the entire roadway had been cleared of debris despite this walmart is the largest retail chain grocery store to locally based giant eagle in addition researchers at the university of south carolina and sam houston state university carried out a study to determine if wal mart affects local crime rates the results of the study found that the crime rate in us counties

miley cyrus line of necklaces and bracelets three months after the associated press informed the chain that the jewelry contained harmful amounts of the toxic metal cadmium long term exposure to cadmium can lead to bone softening and kidney failure it is also a known carcinogen and research suggests that it can affect brain development in the very young cadmium in jewelry is not known to be dangerous if the items are simply worn but concerns come when a child bites or sucks on the jewelry as many children do walmart said that while the jewelry is few younger consumers may seek it out in

has been accused of selling merchandise at such low costs that competitors have tried to sue it for predatory pricing intentionally selling a product at low cost in order to drive competitors out of the market in 1995 in the case of walmart stores inc v american drugs inc pharmacy retailer american drugs accused walmart of selling items at too low a cost for the purpose of injuring competitors and destroying competition the supreme court of arkansas ruled in favor of walmart saying that its pricing including the use of loss leaders was not predatory pricing in 2000 the wisconsin department of agriculture trade and consumer protection accused walmart of selling butter milk laundry detergent and other staple goods at low cost with the monopoly in local markets crest foods filed a similar lawsuit in oklahoma accusing walmart of predatory pricing on several of its products in an effort to drive crest foods s own company owned store in edmond oklahoma out of business both cases were settled out of court in 2003 mexico s antitrust agency the federal competition commission investigated walmart for monopolistic practices prompted by charges that the retailer pressured suppliers to sell goods below cost or at prices significantly less than those available to other stores mexican authorities found no wrongdoing on the part of walmart however in 2003 germany s high court ruled that walmart s low cost pricing strategy undermined competition and ordered walmart and two other supermarkets to raise their prices walmart won appeal of the ruling then the german supreme court overturned the appeal walmart has since sold its stores in germany walmart has been accused of using monopoly power to force its suppliers into self defeating practices for example barry c lynn a senior fellow at the new walmart s constant demand for lower prices caused kraft foods to shut down thirty nine plants to let go of 13 500 workers and to eliminate a quarter of its products kraft was unable to compete with other suppliers and says the cost of production had gone up due to higher energy and raw material costs lynn says that in a free market kraft could have passed those costs on to its distributors and ultimately consumers for example most walmart store pharmacies fill many generic prescriptions for 4 for a month s supply however in california and ten other states complaints from other pharmacies have resulted in walmart being required to charge at least 9 for a month s supply of certain drugs employee and labor relations with close to 2 2 million employees worldwide walmart has faced a torrent of lawsuits and issues with regards to its workforce these issues involve low wages poor working conditions inadequate health care as well as issues involving the company s strong anti union policies critics point to walmart although other factors may be involved approximately 70 of its employees leave within the first year despite the high turnover rate the company still is able to lower unemployment rates a study by oklahoma state university states walmart is found to have substantially lowered the relative unemployment rates of blacks in those counties where it is present but to have had only a limited impact on relative incomes after the influences of other socio economic variables were taken into account wages the activist group los angeles alliance for a new economy laane said in 2006 walmart reports that full time hourly associates received on average 10 11 an hour laane further calculated that working 34 hours per week an walmart employee earns 17 874 per year which is roughly twenty percent less than the average retail worker the number of hours the average retail worker worked was not specified the report from laane further opines that this pay is over 10 000 less than what the average two person family needs walmart managers to control payroll costs the wall street journal says this puts extra pressure on higher paid workers to be more productive walmart insists its wages are generally in line with the current local market in retail labor other critics have noted that in 2001 the average wage for a walmart sales clerk was 8 23 per hour or 13 861 a year while the federal poverty line for a family of three was 14 630 walmart founder sam walton once said i pay low wages i can take advantage of that we re going to be successful but the basis is a very low wage low benefit model of employment in august 2006 walmart announced that it would roll out an average pay increase of 6 for all new hires at 1 200 u s walmart and sam s club locations but at the same time would institute pay caps on veteran workers while walmart maintains that the measures are necessary to stay competitive critics believe that the salary caps are primarily an effort to push higher paid veteran workers out of the least 352 million to settle lawsuits claiming that it forced employees to work off the clock several lawyers described it as the largest settlement ever for lawsuits over wage violations because walmart employs part time and relatively low paid workers some workers may partially qualify for state welfare programs this has led critics to claim that walmart increases the burden on taxpayer funded services a 2002 survey by the state of georgia s subsidized healthcare system peachcare found that walmart was the largest private employer of parents of children enrolled in its program one quarter of the employees of georgia walmarts qualified to enroll their children in the federal subsidized healthcare system medicaid a 2004 study at the university of california berkeley charges that walmart s low wages and benefits are insufficient and although decreasing the burden on the social safety net to some extent california taxpayers still pay 86 million a year to walmart employees on september 4 2008 the mexican supreme court of justice ruled that wal mart de mexico the mexican subsidiary of walmart only at wal mart stores working conditions walmart has also faced accusations involving poor working conditions for its employees for example a 2005 class action lawsuit in missouri asserted approximately 160 000 to 200 000 people who were forced to work off the clock were denied overtime pay or were not allowed to take rest and lunch breaks in 2000 walmart paid 50 million to settle a class action suit that asserted that 69 000 current and former walmart employees in colorado had been forced to work off the clock the company has also faced similar lawsuits in other states including pennsylvania oregon and minnesota class action suits were also filed in 1995 on behalf of full time walmart pharmacists whose base salaries and working hours were reduced as sales declined resulting in the pharmacists being treated like hourly employees walmart has also been accused of ethical problems it is said that the walmart employees are gender discriminated during the hiring process and discriminated against in the work area wal mart v dukes was a discrimination case on behalf of more 3 400 stores across the united states 9th circuit 2007 dr william bliebly who evaluated walmarts employment policies against what social science research shows to be factors that create and sustain bias and those that minimize bias bliebly and he finished by saying the men and women not being created equal in the workforce is what walmart is doing and what they should essentially not be doing on october 16 2006 approximately 200 workers on the morning shift at a walmart super center in hialeah gardens florida walked out in protest against new store policies and rallied outside the store shouting we want justice and criticizing the company s recent policies as inhuman this marks the first time that walmart had faced a worker led revolt of such scale according to both employees and the company reasons for the revolt included cutting full time hours a new attendance policy and pay caps that the company imposed in august 2006 compelling workers to be available to work any shift day swing or night and and not by local managers walmart quickly held talks with the workers addressing their concerns walmart asserts that its policy permits associates to air grievances without fear of retaliation a 2004 report by u s representative george miller alleged that in ten percent of walmart s stores nighttime employees were locked inside holding them prisoner there has been some concern that walmart s policy of locking its nighttime employees in the building has been implicated in a longer response time to dealing with various employee emergencies or weather conditions such as hurricanes in florida walmart said this policy was to protect the workers and the store s contents in high crime areas and acknowledges that some employees were inconvenienced in some instances for up to an hour as they had trouble locating a manager with the key however fire officials confirm that at no time were fire exits locked or employees blocked from escape walmart has advised all stores to ensure the door keys are available on site at all times in january 2004 the new york conducted in july 2000 which examined one week s time clock records for roughly 25 000 employees according to the times the audit pointed to extensive violations of child labor laws and state regulations requiring time for breaks and meals including 1 371 instances of minors working too late during school hours or for too many hours in a day there were 60 767 missed breaks and 15 705 lost meal times walmarts vice president for communications responded that company auditors had determined that the methodology used by the ny times was flawed and the company did not respond to it in any way internally walmart has been accused of allowing undocumented workers to work in its stores in one case federal investigators say walmart executives knew that contractors were using undocumented workers as they had been helping the federal government with an investigation for the previous three years some critics said that walmart directly hired undocumented workers while walmart says they were employed by contractors who won bids to work for walmart on october 23 2003 federal agents crackdown known as operation rollback resulting in the arrests of 250 nightshift janitors who were undocumented following the arrests a grand jury convened to consider charging walmart executives with labor racketeering crimes for knowingly allowing undocumented workers to work at their stores the workers themselves were employed by agencies walmart contracted with for cleaning services walmart blamed the contractors but federal investigators point to wiretapped conversations showing that executives knew some workers did not have the correct documentation the october 2003 raid was not the first time walmart was found using unauthorized workers earlier raids in 1998 and 2001 resulted in the arrests of 100 workers without documentation located at walmart stores around the country in november 2005 125 alleged undocumented workers were arrested while working on construction of a new walmart distribution center in eastern pennsylvania according to walmart the workers were employees of walmart s construction subcontractor allegations of wrongful termination on january 13 2011 four employees at a walmart in layton utah were confronted by a shoplifter who pulled out a attempt to leave a small closed office the other three employees disarmed and subdued the shoplifter and all four held onto the man until police arrived a week later the four employees were fired for violating a company policy requiring employees to disengage and withdraw from any situation involving a weapon the four fired employees together with two other walmart employees who had been fired after subduing violent customers filed a lawsuit against the company in u s federal court in june 2011 on july 9 2013 an employee at a walmart in kemptville ontario confronted a customer who had left his dog locked in his truck with the windows rolled up she called police when the customer refused to rectify the situation the employee was fired later the same day reportedly on the grounds of being rude to a customer after rejecting instructions from her manager that such incidents should be reported to the store management rather than directly to the police the national labor relations board nlrb has long had the who engage in concerted activity by speaking with each other regarding conditions wages and or benefits the nlrb has recently stated that this also applies to social media the key point is whether or not the intent appears to be to communicate with fellow employees and walmart s official policy is viewed as acceptable and not overly restrictive in this regard revised in part after consultations with the nrlb however in practice walmart may not always follow such a policy for example a sept 2013 article in the atlantic wire reports the case of a 17 year veteran of walmart s paramount california location who started at 5 50 an hour as an overnight stocker and became a manager in housewares for 14 years i was a model associate he states in 2012 he became increasingly involved with our walmart and was fired in may 2013 he reports that after he began speaking about labor conditions they started silencing me by holding me to standards that they were n t holding other associates to on me was unsurmountable employees using prescription drugs in november 2009 joseph casias a cancer patient with a prescription for marijuana was fired from walmart in battle creek michigan for using medical marijuana walmart spokesman greg rossiter said that walmart policy is to terminate employees who take certain prescription medications and he believed that this policy complied with the law health insurance according to a september 2002 survey by the state of georgia one in four children of walmart employees were enrolled in peachcare for kids the state s health insurance program for uninsured children compared to the state s second biggest employer publix which had one child in the program for every 22 children of employees a december 2004 nationwide survey commissioned by walmart showed that the use of public assistance health care programs by children of walmart workers was at a similar rate to other retailers employees and at rates similar to the u s population as a whole as of october 2005 walmart s health insurance covered 44 or approximately 572 000 walmart rival and wholesaler costco insures approximately 85 of its workers in 2003 walmart spent an average of 3 500 per employee for health care 27 less than the retail industry average of 4 800 when asked why so many walmart workers choose to enroll in state health care plans instead of walmart s own plan walmart ceo lee scott acknowledged that some states benefits may be more generous than walmart s own plan in some of our states the public program may actually be a better value with relatively high income limits to qualify and low premiums critics of walmart say in wal mart the high cost of low price that employees are paid so little they can not afford health insurance on october 26 2005 a walmart internal memo sent to the firm s board of directors advised trimming over 1 billion in health care expenses by 2011 through measures such as attracting a younger implicitly healthier work force by offering education benefits the memo also suggested giving sedentary walmart staffers such as and eliminating full time positions in favor of hiring part time employees who would be ineligible for the more expensive health insurance and several policy proposals which may violate the americans with disabilities act of 1990 the memo also accused walmart s lower paid employees of abusing emergency room visits possibly due to their prior experience with programs such as medicaid whereas such visits may actually be due to the reduced ability of uninsured or underinsured people to make timely appointments to see a regular physician critics point to this internal memo as evidence that walmart purports to be generous with its employee benefits while in reality the company is working to cut such benefits by reducing the number of full time and long term employees and discouraging supposedly unhealthy people from working at walmart on january 12 2006 the maryland legislature enacted a law requiring that all corporations with more than 10 000 employees in the state spend at least eight percent of their payroll on employee benefits or pay into a state fund for the uninsured walmart with about 17 000 employees in this requirement before the bill passed on july 7 2006 the maryland law was overturned in federal court by a u s district judge who held that a federal law the employee retirement income security act erisa preempted the maryland law the judge said the law would hurt walmart by imposing the administrative burden of tracking benefits in maryland differently than in other states similar legislation in wisconsin days later was defeated in the state legislature on april 17 2006 walmart announced it was making a health care plan available to part time workers after one year of service instead of the prior two year requirement one criticism of the new plan is that it provides benefit only after a 1 000 deductible is paid 3 000 for a family these deductibles may financially be out of reach for eligible part time workers walmart estimates this change can add 150 000 workers to health coverage plans if all who are eligible take part by january 2007 the number of workers enrolled in the company s health care introduction of less expensive insurance policies however even with this increase less than half of walmart s employees or 47 4 received health insurance through the company with 10 or 130 000 receiving no coverage at all in march 2008 walmart sued a former walmart employee deborah shank to recover the money it spent for her health care after she was brain damaged restricted to a wheelchair and nursing home bound after her minivan was hit by a truck walmart sued the former employee for 470 000 after she received a settlement from the accident citing that company policy forbids employees from receiving coverage if they also win a settlement in a lawsuit after a wave of bad publicity walmart dropped its suit new full time walmart associates must work at least six months before being eligible to purchase the company s primary health insurance in 2011 walmart stopped providing health insurance for part time employees working under 24 hours per week in 2013 health insurance benefits will not be available to employees who labor and health care observed that the change will shift the burden of providing health care for walmart employees to the federal government as eligibility for medicaid has been expanded under the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca or aca an analysis of walmart s health plans as compared to plans offered in the aca s health insurance marketplaces found that walmart s plans have larger networks of providers than most plans in the marketplaces and that gross premiums before accounting for tax credits are less expensive under walmart s plans labor union opposition walmart has been criticized for its policies against labor unions critics blame workers reluctance to join the labor union on walmart anti union tactics such as managerial surveillance and pre emptive closures of stores or departments who choose to unionize walmart states that it is not anti union but pro associate arguing that its employees do not need to pay third parties to discuss problems with management as the company s open door policy enables employees to lodge complaints and submit suggestions all the way up founder sam walton resisted a unionization push by the retail clerks international union in two small missouri towns by hiring a professional union buster to conduct an anti union campaign on the union buster s advice walton also took steps to show his workers on how the company had their best interests in mind encouraging them to air concerns with managers and implementing a profit sharing program a few years later walmart hired a consulting firm alpha associates to develop a union avoidance program in 2000 meat cutters in jacksonville texas voted to unionize and walmart subsequently eliminated in house meat cutting jobs in favor of prepackaged meats on the claims that it cut costs and was a preventive measure to lawsuits walmart said that the nationwide closing of in store meat packaging had been planned for many years and was not related to the unionization in june 2003 a national labor relations board judge ordered walmart to restore the meat department to its prior structure complete with meat cutting and to recognize and bargain with the union over the effects of policies also extend beyond the united states the documentary wal mart the high cost of low price shows one successful unionization of a walmart store in jonquire quebec canada in 2004 but walmart closed the store five months later because the company did not approve of the new business plan a union would require in september 2005 the qubec labor board ruled that the closing of a walmart store amounted to a reprisal against unionized workers and has ordered additional hearings on possible compensation for the employees though it offered no details in march 2005 walmart executive tom coughlin was forced to resign from its board of directors facing charges of embezzlement coughlin said that the money was used for an anti union project involving cash bribes paid to employees of the united food and commercial workers union in exchange for a list of names of walmart employees that had signed union cards he also said that the money was unofficially paid to him by walmart as compensation for his anti union efforts money merchandise and gift cards from walmart but avoided prison time due to his poor health he was sentenced to five years probation and required to pay a 50 000 fine and 411 000 in restitution to walmart and the internal revenue service a u s attorney has stated that no evidence was found to back up coughlin s initial claims and walmart continues to deny the existence of the anti union program though coughlin himself apparently restated those claims to reporters after his conviction for walmart has also had some run ins with the german ver di labor union as well these issues combined with cultural differences and low performing stores led walmart to pull out of the german market entirely in 2006 in august 2006 walmart announced that it would allow workers at all of its chinese stores to become members of trade unions and that the company would work with the state sanctioned all china federation of trade unions acftu on representation for its 28 000 staff however the all china federation of trade unions has been criticized because it tool of the government acftu has been seen as not acting in the best interest of its members workers bowing to the government pressure on industry growth and not defending workers rights in november 2012 the united food amp commercial workers joined with several walmart workers with a plan to go on strike on black friday at several stores nationwide in protest to low pay an increase in health insurance premiums and not being given the option to have the day off or having thanksgiving off walmart has countered this by saying that the strike is illegal due to the union not being sanctioned by the company and that the striking workers are a small minority of the company s workforce with the vast majority of workers willing and ready to work the retail industry s busiest day of the year many of the states where the ufcw plans to go on strike with the walmart employees have at will employment laws protecting the company in may 2013 walmart employees associated with a union backed labor group called will be the first prolonged strikes in walmart s history for thanksgiving 2013 cnn estimates that approximately a million u s walmart employees will work over the course of the holiday with big specials starting at 6 00 pm on thanksgiving day the company states that employees will receive a nice thanksgiving dinner at work extra holiday pay and 25 discount off one purchase regardless of how many items are purchased at that time according to the cleveland plain dealer the extra holiday pay equals the average daily shift the employee worked during the previous two weeks as far as price specials walmart is expanding its one hour guarantee from three items last year to twenty one items this year this means that a customer standing in line for such an item between 6 7 pm or from 8 9 pm will be guaranteed to get it at that price some point before christmas poorly run and understaffed stores in a january 2012 article in the harvard business review zeynep group at mit s sloan school of management states that in response to reductions in sales walmart often understaffs in knee jerk fashion labor is seen as a cost driver rather than a sales driver managers do nt have much direct control over sales almost never making decisions on merchandise mix layout price or promotions but managers do have control and are evaluated regarding whether they meet weekly or monthly targets for payroll as a percentage of sales at times these pressures have been such that walmart managers previously pressured employees to work off the clock as counter examples of companies which both invest in their employees and are price leaders in their fields prof ton cites quiktrip convenience stores mercadona and trader joes supermarkets and costco wholesale clubs in february 2013 walmart received an american customer satisfaction index rating of 71 as compared to 81 for target placing walmart last for the year among retail and department stores according to bloomberg news this marks the sixth year in last according to a march 2013 bloomberg news article during the last five years walmart added 455 u s stores for a 13 increase during this same period its overall u s employees including sam s clubs employees went down ever so slightly at 1 4 which translates to a reduction of 20 000 employees in wisconsin an employee who oversees grocery deliveries and who is a member of our walmart reports that the store is a long way from the previous mantra of in the door and to the floor instead merchandise ready for the sales floor remains on pallets and in steel bins in the back of the store with no passable aisles prof zeynep ton states that companies can get in a downward spiral where too few labor hours lead to operational problems and lower sales and these reduced sales then become a rationale to reduce labor hours even further it requires a wake up call at a higher level she said a customer who is a retired accountant from delaware states that the cosmetics section looked company self destruct but there are other places to go a customer in california states you wait 20 25 minutes for someone to help you then the person was not trained on mixing paint it was like you have to help them help you an april 3 2013 new york times article cites supermarket news that walmart s grocery prices are usually about 15 percent cheaper than competitors at the start of 2007 the company had an average of 338 employees for each walmart and sam s club store in the united states and by april 2013 this had reduced to an average of 281 employees per store terrie ellerbee associate editor of grocery publication the shelby report traced the problem to 2010 when walmart reduced the number of different merchandise items carried in an attempt to make stores less cluttered customers did not like this change and walmart added the merchandise back but did not add employees back an includes photographs of walmart shelves which are only partially stocked primarily in health and beauty products one employee is quoted as saying as soon as we get a full crew we start to lose people through them quitting or being fired management seems to wait until we need 6 or 7 people then we get a rash of new hires and another employee is quoted as saying they make the rest of us work faster and harder saying the task manager system which is basically a point of sale system telling them how long it should take us to do our job says we should be done already or were taking too long an april 9 2013 article in time business amp money reported that some walmart stores have cut labor hours so much that they were having trouble physically moving merchandise from the back onto stores shelves however even with these problems walmart was performing better than target in the measure of retail turnover turning over its entire inventory 8 walmart states it has 90 to 95 in stock but given inventory levels in u s stores even this means the company could be foregoing 1 29 billion to 2 58 billion in potential sales the article s author writes that no amount of computer wizardry will eliminate the need for human beings to also move merchandise onto shelves the author further writes that walmart s whole business model is based on reducing the carrying costs of unsold merchandise and any speed bump along the line adds back costs front end managers are supposed to open another register any time there are more than three customers in line but these employees have to come from some other part of the store and the night crew may or may not be able to catch up in sept 2013 bloomberg businessweek reported that walmart will be offering 35 000 part time employees full time jobs and will be offering another 35 000 temporary employees permanent part time positions walmart will also be looking to hire 55 000 seasonal employees for the upcoming holiday season this compares to 120 000 this number does conflict with the 20 000 jobs cut from the above bloomberg news of march 2013 for thanksgiving 2013 specials walmart included twenty one items which included a one hour guarantee where customers would pay at that time and then go online to arrange delivery to a store of their choice by christmas in february 2014 a local nbc affiliate in troy alabama united states showed photographs of empty shelves and aired customer complaints with one customer stating and merchandise when you do n t have any salt on the shelf no matter what brand that s pretty bad regarding the cleanliness and repair of restrooms another customer stated the bathrooms they have things that are broken in there and instead of fixing the problem they have a trash bag taped over it and it smells horrible the reporter who was taking photographs was approached by three persons who identified themselves as managers and escorted out of the store within 24 hours perhaps motivated by the s corporate office sent additional employees from neighboring stores to this store imports and globalization as a large customer to most of its vendors walmart openly uses its bargaining power to bring lower prices to attract its customers the company negotiates lower prices from vendors for certain basic products walmart has a clear policy that prices go down from year to year if a vendor does not keep prices competitive with other suppliers they risk having their brand removed from walmart s shelves in favor of a lower priced competitor critics say that this pressures vendors to shift manufacturing jobs to china and other nations where the cost of labor is less expensive while sam walton was alive walmart had a buy american campaign but it was exposed shortly after he died that signs saying buy american were on bins of asian made products yet by 2005 about 60 of walmart s merchandise was imported compared to 6 in 1984 although others estimated the percentage was 40 from the beginning in 2004 if it were an individual economy the company would rank as china s eighth largest trading partner ahead of russia australia and canada one group estimates that the growing u s trade deficit with china heavily influenced by walmart imports is estimated to have moved over 1 5 million jobs that might otherwise be in america to china between 1989 and 2003 according to the american federation of labor and congress of industrial organizations afl cio walmart is the single largest importer of foreign produced goods in the united states their biggest trading partner is china and their trade with china alone constitutes approximately 10 of the total u s trade deficit with china overseas labor concerns walmart has been criticized for not providing adequate supervision of its foreign suppliers it has also been criticized for using sweatshops and prison labor in 1995 chinese dissident harry wu charged that walmart was contracting prison labor in guangdong province walmart said it did not use prison labor there have also been reports of teenagers in bangladesh working for walmart supplier beximco the documentary film wal mart the high cost of low price shows images of walmart goods producing factories in poor condition and factory workers subject to abuse and conditions that the documentary producers considered inhumane walmart points out that wages paid to overseas workers are comparable to or exceed local prevailing wages the company says that the overseas manufacturing jobs it creates are often an improvement in the quality of life for its employees they have also drawn attention to the fact that factory jobs with its suppliers are often safer and healthier than local alternatives which may include prostitution the drug trade or scavenging walmart currently uses monitoring which critics say is inadequate and leaves outsiders unable to verify conditions since walmart will not release its audits or factory names outside organizations are expected to simply accept walmart s claims as fact critics suggest an agency such as social accountability international or the fair labor association should do the monitoring in 2004 walmart began working with business for to reach out to groups active in monitoring overseas plants in june 2006 walmart was excluded from the investment portfolio of the government pension fund of norway which held stock values of about 430 million in the company due to a social audit into alleged labor rights violations in walmart operations in the united states canada latin america africa and asia although walmart did not respond to questions from the fund s auditors it later said the decision does not appear to be based on complete information on november 24 2012 a fire in a bangladesh clothing factory resulted in the death of 112 workers survivors said that fire extinguishers did not work an exit door was locked and that when the fire alarm went off bosses told workers to return to their sewing machines victims were trapped or jumped to their deaths from the eight story building which had no fire escapes or exits initially walmart said it could not confirm that it had ever sourced apparel from the factory present in the factory after the fire walmart later said that a supplier had subcontracted work to the factory in direct violation of our policies however on december 4 documents revealed that at least five supplier companies had been using the bangladesh factory to provide apparel for walmart and its subsidiary sams club during the past year it was also disclosed in a november 24 new york times article that officials who had attended a 2011 bangladesh meeting to discuss factory safety in the garment industry said that the walmart official there had played the lead role in blocking an effort to have global retailers pay more for apparel to help bangladesh factories improve their electrical and fire safety building collapse at savar on 24 april 2013 an eight

for bangladesh worker safety allegations of bribery and coverup in mexico in 2012 the new york times reported that walmart had been made aware eight years earlier that executives of walmart mxico its subsidiary in that country had paid millions of dollars in bribes to local officials to expedite permits for construction and operation of its many stores in that country the company had opened many stores in mexico in the late 1990s and early 2000s attempting to widely establish itself before competitors responsible for obtaining those permits and was bitter about being passed over for the position of general counsel with walmart mxico provided the company s corporate general counsel s office with evidence showing that the company had made large payments to gestores workers who deal with bureaucracies on behalf of citizens and businesses with coded indications that the money was being passed on to officials to expedite permits company officials hired a veteran fbi agent to conduct a preliminary inquiry instead of hiring an outside law firm as it usually did for major inquiries such as a similar one in 2003 which found that walmart mxico had been helping high volume customers evade that country s sales taxes the special investigative team found evidence corroborating almost all of cicero s allegations and evidence suggesting that the bribery had been even more extensive including 16 million in donations to local politicians and their organizations they recommended opening a full investigation and possibly notifying the justice department as it appeared that

from slave ships in asian waters to leading producers and retailers product selection walmart s product selection has been criticized by some groups in the past primarily as viewed as a promotion of a particular ideology or as a response to its original rural religious and conservative target market in 2003 walmart removed certain men s magazines from its shelves such as maxim fhm and stuff citing customer complaints regarding their racy content later that year it decided to partly obscure the covers of cosmopolitan marie claire and redbook on store shelves due to customer concerns and refused to stock an issue of sports illustrated s swimsuit special because it objected to one photograph it has also refused to sell controversial cover depicting the rock doused with fire since 1991 walmart also has not carried music albums marked with the recording industry association of america s riaa s parental advisory label contradictory to the allowance of r rated movies and video games rated mature although it carries edited versions of such albums with obscenities removed or overdubbed with less offensive lyrics in one example in 2005 walmart rejected the original cover of country singer willie nelson s reggae album countryman which featured marijuana leaves in an apparent pro marijuana statement to satisfy walmart the record label lost highway records issued the album with an alternative cover without recalling the original cover walmart has never carried marilyn manson albums solely because of the controversy surrounding the group but recently began selling nine inch nails albums after rejecting them for years in fact some albums that do not carry parental advisory stickers include profanities and are not edited such albums include pink floyd s monkeys whatever people say i am that s what i m not in 2009 green day refused to make an edited version of their album 21st century breakdown for walmart with frontman billie joe armstrong claiming you feel like you re in 1953 or something thus the album is not carried by walmart stores however walmart s policy on carrying albums with the parental advisory label seems to vary by country as albums containing the label can be found in canadian walmart stores for example in 1999 walmart announced that it would not stock emergency contraception pills in its pharmacies not citing any particular reasons except for a business decision that was made earlier the move was criticized by family planning advocates citing that women in small towns where walmart pharmacies had little competition would have greater difficulties in obtaining the drug the decision was challenged in 2006 as three massachusetts women filed suit against the company after they were unable to purchase emergency contraception at their local walmart stores drug in all of its pharmacies in massachusetts expecting that other states would soon do the same walmart reversed its policy and announced that it would begin to stock the drug nationwide while at the same time maintaining its conscientious objection policy allowing any walmart pharmacy employee who does not feel comfortable dispensing a prescription to refer customers to another pharmacy walmart has also been criticized for selling some controversial products for example in 2004 walmart carried the anti semitic hoax the protocols of the elders of zion in its online catalogue the jewish civil rights organization anti defamation league wrote to the president of walmart on september 2008 noting the text has been the major weapon in the arsenals of anti semites around the world and called on walmart to unequivocally state the nature of the book and to disassociate itself from any endorsement of it walmart stopped selling the book shortly thereafter in october 2004 walmart canceled its order for the daily show s america the book u s supreme court judge nude a week later it returned copies of comedian george carlin s when will jesus bring the pork chops with a cover recreating the last supper with jesus seat empty and carlin seated next to it the company said that the copies were shipped to it by mistake and a walmart spokeswoman said she did not believe this particular product would appeal to its customer base in january 2006 walmart was criticized for the recommendation system on its website which suggested that some black related dvds such as introducing dorothy dandridge and documentaries on baptist minister and civil rights leader martin luther king jr were similar to the planet of the apes television series dvd box set it quickly corrected the page saying that it was a software glitch but ultimately blamed the matter on human error a december 2007 report published by the environmental investigation agency a non governmental agency revealed that some furniture sold at walmart was made habitats for siberian tigers and other wildlife this led the company to investigate its suppliers and promise to eliminate products made from illegal wood by 2013 they also joined the global forest amp trade network an organization that is dedicated to eliminating illegal logging taxes until the mid 1990s walmart took out corporate owned life insurance policies on its employees including low level employees such as janitors cashiers and stockers this type of insurance is usually purchased to cover a company against financial loss when a high ranking employee i e management dies and is usually known as key man insurance critics derided walmart as buying what they called dead peasants insurance or janitor insurance critics as well as the u s internal revenue service charge that the company was trying to profit from the deaths of its employees and take advantage of the tax law which allowed it to deduct the premiums the practice was stopped in the mid 1990s when the federal government closed the tax deduction and began to pursue walmart for back taxes of walmart something wall mart this way comes

present george henry moore 1 march 1810 19 april 1870 was an irish politician who served as member of parliament mp for mayo in the parliament of the united kingdom he was one of the founders of the catholic defence association and a leader of the independent irish party he was also father of the writer george a moore and the politician maurice george moore their ancestral home moore hall was burned down in 1923 by the anti treaty ira during the irish civil war public life his grandfather john moore had been appointed president of the short lived republic of connacht in the 1798 rebellion by general humbert at castlebar the independent irish party was damaged by weak leaders and by the lack of support its received from the roman catholic church charles gavan duffy left in despair and went to australia frederick lucas proved an ineffective leader while his successor george henry moore its new leader having got elected in his mayo uk parliament constituency the party split into oblivion members of the group participated in the meeting of mps in 1859 which agreed to support the second palmerston government and which is often regarded as the formal foundation of the liberal party moore contested aggressively against john sadleir and william keogh former allies and friends whom he disowned in elections upon many occasions in various constituencies wherever they presented themselves and at some expense after the two abandoned their principles and party to take british government positions within the irish administration during the irish potato famine moore purchased livestock for his tenants cows were given to many and much grain was imported in bulk and he encouraged tenants to grow alternative crops to the potato none of his tenants starved nor were any evicted full remission for any tenant paying 5 per year and 75 remission for those paying under 10 per annum were ordered in june 1847 a vessel the martha washington was requisitioned by moore the marquess of sligo and sir robert lynch blosse the ship was laden with 1 000 mayo the cargo distributed among their tenants at a combined loss of 4819 0 6d as the famine got worse moore gave grazing lands to the people and placed others directly under his care on his own estate at moore hall speaking out in parliament for the irish in the famine moore declared that disaster followed every scheme that lord trevelyan originated also at a meeting in partry again against the advice of his mother he denounced angrily the idea that a few wandering fanatics and vagabond emissaries from england could extinguish the catholic church with indian meal and soup during the food for conversion schemes that followed in the footsteps of the famine he was chairman of two famine relief committees one at ballintubber and secondly at partry both areas full of destitute people who benefited from his donations by the end of the famine moore and like minded landowners were broke bankruptcy followed but moore was able to buy back large tracts of his land he had fought two scurrilous treatment of tenants and his character moore was a keen hunter and horse racer noted for his well trained stud of hunters of reckless courage with which he rode them around galway known as dog moore after his well known horse wolfdog he set up a series of wagers at race meetings including the grand national tuam and ballinrobe his winnings offset against betting against his own horses netted him around 3 000 000 by today s reckoning and these funds helped greatly feed his tenantry he rode tinderbox in the 1845 grand national falling at the 10th his own brother augustus with whom he recklessly hunted was killed at the 1845 aintree grand national while riding mickey free the sire of fenian winner of the belmont stakes in 1869 and this was said to be the turning point in george s life whereby george gave himself completely to the benefit of the people of his estates his other famous steeds were coranna winner of the chester cup in 1846 whose portrait with coranna george sent 1000 to his tenantry for famine relief croaghpatrick was the winner of the stewards cup at goodwood in 1861 a more unusual horse was faugh a ballaghan ex army steed of the royal irish fusiliers with whom moore wagered heavily with a rather wretched looking mule with knock knees it was able to clear high walls with little effort from a dawdling run up much to the amazement of everyone who witnessed it his own greatest personal feat as a jockey was to win the new melton stakes at cahir on land owned by the marquis of waterford at ronscar moore won on a shelly looking customer the bay gelding anonymous this was said to be one of the greatest races ever run in ireland and the jumps included high and tall stone walls the race was talked about for years after both this horse and the don another steeplechaser were killed soon after the former at worcester racecourse in march 1843 and the latter at the kings county offaly familiar blue birdseye jacket again moore swore not to have anything to do with horseracing again after the death of these two beloved mounts but the promise never held moore also helped in the organisation the construction of a monastery on lough mask near tourmakeady beneath the mountain tournasala with the cooperation of archbishop machale and the local firebrand of ballinrobe the reverend peter conway in his youth george had been a worry to his parents least of all because of his gambling habits and a failure to conclude a formal private education preferring to pursue an alternative education in billiards at which he became expert and all the fun that the cities of bath and london had to offer a young georgian era male however moore hall was a teetotal manor so drinking at least was off limits as the moore family never partook of alcohol he was a writer of very frank open letters to friends of his mother and his enemies of which he gathered many owing to high temperament lady friends telling them exactly what he thought in his youth he had travelled the arab world including syria moore attempted at least to challenge to a duelling at least two men in his youth local landowner joe mr mac dhonnaill of doo or dubh castle for insulting george moore senior and o gorman mahon who later became a parliamentary member with the irish party and the oldest member of the house in his day both perhaps wisely declined though the latter later fought in latin america moore was a member of the fenian brotherhood but was a strong advocate of friendship with the orange lodge among visitors to moorehall in mayo were o donovan rossa and john o connor power the representative for connacht on the supreme council of the irish republican brotherhood he died on 19 april 1870 at moore hall he was succeeded by his brother in law george ekins browne his oration was read by the land league priest father lavelle and his coffin borne to carnacon church by 16 of his tenants mass the interment took place at kiltoom notes references origin los angeles california u s maria luisa mckee born august 17 1964 los angeles california is an american singer songwriter

class of mesophases in which molecules assemble into cylindrical structures to act as mesogens originally these kinds of liquid crystals were called discotic liquid crystals because the columnar structures are composed of flat shaped discotic molecules stacked one dimensionally since recent findings provide a number of columnar liquid crystals consisting of non discoid mesogens it is more common now to classify this state of matter and compounds with these properties as columnar liquid crystals takuzo aida and co workers recently reported cyclic peptides that self assemble into polar columnar organizations these materials can be unidirectionally aligned over large areas by application of an external electric field classes columnar liquid crystals are grouped by their structural order and the ways of packing of the columns nematic columnar liquid crystals have no long range order and are less organized than other columnar liquid crystals other columnar phases with long range order are classified by their two dimensional lattices hexagonal tetragonal rectangular and oblique phases the discotic nematic phase includes nematic liquid crystals composed of flat shaped discotic molecules not form specific columnar assemblies but only float with their short axes in parallel to the director a unit vector which defines the liquid crystalline alignment and order current topics of interest the first discotic liquid crystal was found in 1977 by the indian researcher sivaramakrishna chandrasekhar this molecule has one central benzene ring surrounded by six alkyl chains since then a large number of discoid mesogenic compounds have been discovered in which triphenylene porphyrin phthalocyanine coronene and other aromatic molecules are involved the typical columnar liquid crystalline molecules have a pi electron rich aromatic core attached by flexible alkyl chains this structure is attracting particular attention for potential molecular electronics in which aromatic parts transport electrons or holes and alkyl chains act as insulating parts the advantages of liquid crystalline conductors are their anisotropy processibility and self healing characteristics for

navy she was named for the trepang a marine animal sometimes called a sea slug or a sea cucumber having a long tough muscular body and found in the coral reefs of the east indies when the contract to build her was awarded to mare island navy yard in vallejo california ss 412 was to be named senorita which would have made her the only usn ship to be named for the senorita a brilliantly colored kelpfish found along the california coast she was renamed trepang on 24 september 1942 and her keel was laid down on 25 june 1943 she was launched on 23 march 1944 sponsored by mrs r m davenport the wife of the submarine s prospective commanding officer and commissioned on navy cross winnerin command following shakedown out of san diego california trepang departed the west coast on 15 august 1944 and proceeded to hawaii where her crew trained and prepared the ship for combat first patrol september october 1944 setting out from pearl harbor on 13 september for her first war patrol the submarine prowled the waters south of honsh the largest and most important of japan s home islands she remained below during daylight hours and came up after dark to get a better view as she recharged her batteries and filled up with fresh air on the night of 30 september trepang spotted a fast convoy departing tokyo bay the submarine gave chase and closed in on a group of ships which included two large tankers a small freighter and an escort the submarine fired an overlapping spread of torpedoes which struck the freighter 750 ton takunan maru and sent her to the bottom on 10 october consisted of a pair of tankers and a single escort although the submarine claimed a kill a postwar assessment of the action did not credit her with a sinking the following day the error was reversed the submarine launched four torpedoes at another japanese ship and her commanding officer recorded that all of the fish had missed this time however postwar accounting credited trepang with the destruction of the 1 000 ton transport number 105 on 12 october the submarine cruised some 12 mi southwest of the entrance to tokyo bay soon after she came to the surface and her radar swept the surrounding seas four pips showed themselves on the phosphorescent screentwo large and two smallwhich were identified as two battleships and two destroyers despite the fact that the phosphorescent waters would make his submarine stand out starkly in the night davenport closed at flank speed and fired a full spread of six torpedoes the fish sped through the water toward their targets he claimed success up the night davenport turned the submarine to present her stern tubes to the enemy and loosed four more torpedoes these all missed davenport s gallant and skillfully pressed attacks earned him his fourth navy cross he felt that he had damaged a and had sunk a destroyer but a study of japanese records after the war did not verify either claim her supply of torpedoes exhausted trepang cleared the area and headed for the marshall islands she reached majuro on 23 october for voyage repairs alongside submarine tender and brief training second patrol november december 1944 on 16 november trepang got underway for the philippine islands leading a wolfpack which also included sister ships and the wolfpack s nickname was roy s rangers as trepang s own commanding officer roy m davenport was the officer in charge of the pack the weather was dark windy and rough on 6 december as trepang s conning tower off luzon while shifting course toward deeper water she detected a group of ships approaching from the northward upon closing to investigate trepang counted seven large ships and three escorts in the convoy which slowly approached the philippines trepang radioed news of her find to her packmaster and then submerged the submarine shot straight and true sending freighter banshu maru number 31 and cargo ship jinyo maru to the bottom in quick succession and damaging a third vessel fukuyo maru however as trepang came about to administer the coup de grace to fukuyo maru the third cargo ship obligingly blew up and sank meanwhile as segundo and razorback arrived on the scene trepang fired all of her remaining torpedoes at a fourth ship which she reported blew up and sank soon thereafter however in the meantime the other two american submarines were trying to finish off the fleeing remnants of the shattered convoy and managed to sink two ships one with the aid of american naval aircraft trepang now out of torpedoes sped back to pearl harbor arriving before christmas following this war patrol davenport one of the most highly decorated submariners of the war left trepang for shore duty as an instructor at the united states naval academy third patrol january march 1945 again sailing for honsh trepang now under cmdr allen r faustteamed up with submarines and known as mac s mops on an anti picket boat sweep past nanp islands the eastern island chain south of tokyo to clear the sea lanes for the aircraft carriers of task force 58 which in turn was about to strike the japanese home islands to neutralize them during the assault on the strategic island of iwo jima trepang had to settle for performing lifeguard duty for aircraft carrier assaults on tokyo on 24 february 1945 the submarine sank the 875 ton freighter usuki maru and blew the bow off another small coastal vessel while maneuvering to finish off the crippled ship several antisubmarine vessels appeared on the scene from behind a nearby headland and converged on the fleet boat trepang dove deep as the japanese subjected her to a seven hour depth charge barrage on 17 march trepang attacked and sank 117 ton picket boat tsukiura maru converted bonito amp tunny fishing boat off torishima fourth patrol april may 1945 following her return to guam in march trepang headed for the yellow sea a hazardous duty area due to its vast stretches of shallow water despite the danger the submarine performed well bagging the 1000 ton landing craft transport number 146 on 28 april the 4667 ton heavily laden freighter minesweeper number 20 which blew sky high with a hit on her magazine on 4 may in addition the submarine surfaced to shell a junk with a load of lumber the sole member of this victim s crew a korean understood little sign language and looked to be of little value for intelligence purposes so he was put back on board his barely seaworthy craft with tools and food and sent on his way leaving the yellow sea trepang did a short tour of lifeguarding for b 25 mitchell strikes on shanghai china and for the continuing series of b 29 superfortress raids on tokyo before she returned to guam fifth patrol june july 1945 trepang s fifth war patrol was divided into two partsthe first saw the ship operating in a lifeguard capacity while the second gave her a more offensive role off northeastern honsh and eastern hokkaid in the former role she arrived on station to the southeast of tokyo trepang s men expected a series of long dull days spent moving in circles squares or triangles to break the monotony however shortly before noon on her first day lookouts spotted a blossoming parachute overhead and soon saw the splash of a crashed p 51 mustang fighter damaged while escorting superfortresses to tokyo trepang bent on full power and soon picked up the downed aviator second lieutenant lamar christian usaaf safe and sound during the maneuver another mustang piloted by first lieutenant frank ayres usaaf radioed that it too was in trouble and the pilot requested permission to bail out trepang replied telling ayres to be patient until the first rescue was complete ayres circled the submarine until christian was safely on board the submarine ayres then executed a perfect jump and landed some 400 yd away from trepang and was soon hauled on board three days after rescuing the two airmen was on her way home with 30 other aviators already on board in the middle of the transfer the submarines picked up a radio message from a boxkite rescue search plane that a superfortress crew downed the previous day was floating a mere seven miles 10 km from the japanese seaport of nagoya accompanied by sister ship which had also been discharging passengers to tigrone trepang surged ahead the two submarines raced to save the superfortress s crew trepang put on full speed and arrived on the scene first she found eight survivors in four groups of rafts spread over about four miles 6 km of ocean by the time springer arrived on the scene trepang had picked up seven of the fliers springer picked up the last man en route to a rendezvous with submarine trepang sighted a small troop laden a dozen or so japanese soldiers from the flaming vessel refused to be picked up and taken prisoner and so were left to drown subsequently patrolling off the eastern coast of honsh trepang went scoreless until july when she spotted a coastal convoy of three ships she torpedoed and sank the lead ship koun maru number two but the other vessels conducted evasive action and sped away from the scene at full speed satisfied that she had done her best trepang heading to seaward suddenly shuddered under the impact of two depth bomb explosions a solitary japanese plane had spotted trepang s shadow in the shallow waters and had attacked with depth bombs fortunately all missed their mark given another lifeguarding assignment trepang stood on the alert to pick up possible downed airmen from british and american carrier strikes on the japanese home islands during this tour in july 1945 she rescued one pilot lieutenant addition on 14 july she witnessed a shore bombardment conducted by three battleships and a heavy cruiser against kamaishi by now the war was moving fast and trepang returned to pearl harbor for a refit there she watched the tumbling succession of staggering headlinesfirst the atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki the soviet union s entry into the far eastern war japan s tentative acceptance of surrender terms and finally on 15 august peace at last post war activities after completion of her refit trepang departed pearl harbor and arrived at san diego on 3 september 1945 decommissioned on 27 june 1946 and placed in reserve at vallejo california at the mare island navy yard trepang remained in reserve into the 1960s she was redesignated as an auxiliary submarine and given hull classification symbol agss 412 on 11 june 1962 struck from the naval vessel register on 30 june 1967 the submarine was authorized for disposal on 22 during exercise strike ex 4 69 on 16 september 1969 by the combined gunfire of destroyers and trepang received five battle stars for world war ii service and a navy unit commendation myod is a protein with a key role in regulating muscle differentiation myod belongs to a family of proteins known as myogenic regulatory factors mrfs these bhlh basic helix loop helix transcription factors act sequentially in myogenic differentiation mrf family members include myod myf5 myogenin and mrf4 myf6 myod is one of the earliest markers of myogenic commitment myod is expressed in activated satellite cells but not in quiescent satellite cells although myod marks myoblast commitment muscle development is not dramatically ablated in mouse mutants lacking the myod gene this is likely to be due to functional redundancy from myf5 nevertheless the combination of myod and myf5 is vital to the success of myogenesis functions of myod the function of myod in development is to commit mesoderm cells to a skeletal lineage and then to regulate that process myod may also play a role in regulating muscle repair myod mrna levels are also reported to be elevated in aging skeletal muscle one from the cell cycle halt proliferation by enhancing the transcription of p21 myod is inhibited by cyclin dependent kinases cdks cdks are in turn inhibited by p21 thus myod enhances its own activity in the cell interactions myod has been shown to interact with hdac1 id1 id2 retinoblastoma protein stat3 csrp3 cyclin dependent kinase 4 creb binding protein tcf3 mos ep300 c jun cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1c retinoid x receptor alpha and mdfi coactivators of myod ifrd1 is a positive cofactor of myod as it cooperates with myod at inducing the transcriptional activity of mef2c by displacing hdac4 from mef2c moreover ifrd1 also represses the transcriptional activity of nf b which is known to inhibit myod mrna accumulation birthplace coln panama panama position forward jorge

after the itata incident had ended the american cruiser put in at valparaso on 16 october a group of sailors from baltimore ashore on liberty were attacked by congressionalists still angry at the itata affair two of baltimore s sailors were killed and eighteen wounded thirty six other american sailors were arrested by the local authorities tensions ran high in both chile and the united states yorktown a part of the united states response departed charlotte amalie for valparaso on 17 october for a six week storm tossed voyage around the south american continent via the straits of magellan less than two weeks after yorktown s 30 november arrival baltimore departed yorktown over the ensuing weeks chile and the united states came close to war but cooler heads prevailed locally evans patience was dangerously tested but it held one inflammatory incident occurred when chilean torpedo boats bore down on evans ship turning their helms hard over at the last possible instant to avoid a collision on another occasion a group of locals threw rocks at evans and his gig as it lay at the foot of a jetty after a month at valparaso yorktown took on refugees from the american spanish and italian legations in mid january 1892 she got underway on the 19th and arrived at callao peru on the 25th while yorktown lay anchored there tension between the united states and chile relaxed and the crisis abated and the chilean later government provided compensation for the families of the american sailors that were killed sealing patrol yorktown stood out of diego and san francisco and eventually arrived at the mare island navy yard vallejo california the gunboat subsequently underwent repairs there until late in the following month having weathered one diplomatic storm and international incident evans and his command soon set sail on another mission that if handled wrongly could have caused ill feeling with the british that spring yorktown along with two other naval vessels and a trio of revenue cuttersheaded toward arctic waters on 27 april to protect the great herds of seals in the bering sea from poachers traveling along the west coast of the united states the gunboat and her crew braced in evans words at the prospect of doing something as at valparaso evans faced the possibility of becoming involved in an international incident arising from possible confrontations with canadian sealers operating under the protection of the british crown the latter had taken particularly heavy catches many american vessels put to sea under the british flag in an attempt to evade prosecution by an end to the slaughter of seals and decided upon joint action with the united states in prosecuting the poachers about 110 schooners large and small made up the sealing fleet typically armed with double barrelled shotguns for killing the animals and winchester rifles for dealing with any humans who attempted to interfere the fact that the great majority of seals killed had been female still with young in many casesalmost doubled the toll of slain seals as evans noted the slaughter in the north pacific was fearful arriving at port townsend washington on 30 april yorktown put to sea on 13 may arriving at iliuliuk unalaska one week later coaling there the gunboat skirted the ice floes near the seal rookeries of the pribilof islands reconnoitering the vicinity for sealers assisted by a revenue cutter yorktown guarded the passes to the bering sea the crews of the patrolling american ships lacked fresh provisions but carried on in spite of the hardships imposed by proved abundant codfish was the staple with an occasional gourmet treat of salmon telescopic gunsight besides the patrols made during this deployment in northwestern waters yorktown conducted routine operations such as target practices among the officers assigned to the ship at that time was lt bradley fiske a young officer who had invented and constructed a practical telescopic gunsight fiske s sight had been tested in baltimore and had favorably impressed that ship s officersincluding her commander captain winfeld s schley evans however had not taken a liking to fiske s newfangled gadget but nevertheless consented to allow a second test on board yorktown the first one had failed miserably on the afternoon of 22 september 1892 during scheduled target practice fiske s invention worked as designed and elicited praise from evans as fiske himself later wrote in the united states naval institute s magazine proceedings modern naval gunnery had its birth not in the british in yorktown yorktown continued her task of patrolling until 21 september when she departed unalaska for the mare island navy yard from 11 to 24 october the ship underwent repairs there before proceeding on to the east coast via cape horn yorktown eventually arrived at norfolk virginia on 24 february 1893 after repairs at the new york navy yard from 25 april to 26 july yorktown retraced her route south and sailed again around cape horn back into the pacific she then moved north to resume patrolling the bering sea she protected seal rookeries into 1894 before returning to

18 november 1897 subsequently laid up at mare island and decommissioned on 8 december the gunboat remained inactive there through the spanish american war in 1898 18981903 recommissioned on 17 november 1898 with commander charles s sperry in command yorktown sailed again for the far east on 7 january 1899 rumors of german machinations in samoa lengthened yorktown s stay at hawaii from a few days to a few weeks but when the anticipated trouble failed to materialize yorktown resumed her voyage to the philippine islands on 23 february she arrived at cavite navy yard near manila where patrolled to prevent gun runners thought to be supplying guns and ammunition to the insurrectos filipinos fighting for independence at one point rumors flew concerning possible german gun running activities and yorktown patrolled off the entrance to subic bay and from thence to lingayen to keep work over the next three years cooperating with the army transporting and convoying troops and patrolling wide areas of often badly charted waters upon occasion yorktown served as mother ship to smaller gunboats providing officers and men to staff the smaller patrol craft ensigns william

drowning while the ship was in port at yokohama japan for his efforts quick was awarded a peacetime medal of honor yorktown departed the far east in early 1903 and returned to mare island on 3 june two weeks later on the 17th she was decommissioned 19061912 recommissioned at mare island on 1 october 1906 with commander richard t mulligan out there until 9 november underway on that day she operated off the west coasts of mexico honduras and nicaragua into the following summer after repairs at san francisco and mare island yorktown conducted target practice at magdalena bay mexico and relieved as station ship at acapulco she then cruised with the 2d squadron of the pacific fleet to magdalena bay and san francisco over the ensuing months yorktown continued her regular local operations yorktown hosted the secretary of the navy victor h metcalf to witness the arrival of the great white fleetcommanded by yorktown s former commander robley fightin bob evansinto san francisco the fleet arrived on 6 may 1908 and the flagship saluted the secretary s flag on yorktown with the discharge of seventeen guns metcalf also boarded yorktown on the 8th to review the assembled battleships armored cruisers and torpedo boats of the yorktown participated in festivities for the rose festival at portland oregon from june to september yorktown conducted seal patrols in alaskan waters out of nome unalaska and sitka and between 15 and 19 september established a site for a wireless station at valdez afterwards yorktown sailed south to rejoin the pacific fleet conducting battle practices between 19 november and 1 december at magdalena bay she later joined the armored cruisers and and the tender at acajutla el salvador before sailing for corinto nicaragua in march 1909 after more target practices at magdalena bay yorktown was repaired at mare island in june and into july before shifting to seattle to participate in festivities for the alaska yukon pacific exposition later in july the ship visited esquimalt british columbia she subsequently cruised off the pacific coast and participated in the portol festival at san francisco in october from 13 december 1909 to 27 march nicaragua with the nicaraguan expeditionary squadron she then pursued a schedule of exercises and maneuvers operating between california and british columbia through june and july she returned to a posture of readiness off corinto and san juan del sur between 13 august and 7 september she then operated off ecuadorian colombian and peruvian ports with the united states consul general at large embarked between 19 september and 16 october before putting into panama for coal and stores she subsequently patrolled at amapala honduras and the familiar corinto for most of november and december she spent christmas at corinto before shifting to amapala en route to san francisco and mare island from march to july 1911 yorktown cruised off the west coasts of mexico nicaragua and honduras on 29 may she rescued the survivors from the foundered panamanian steamer which had sunk with the loss of 60 of its 100 passengers and crew another period of repairs and upkeep in the late summer of 1911 south and central america she returned to mare island in may 1912 and was decommissioned there for alterations on 15 july 19131919 recommissioned on 1 april 1913 with commander george b bradshaw in command yorktown operated out of san diego on shakedown into mid april she was soon back at corinto however remaining in nicaragua until 5 june after a brief period of operations off the coast she returned to corinto on 21 june and remained there for over a month before departing on 31 july to coal at salina cruz mexico she moved to mazatln on 10 august and there picked up mail delivering it to the port of topolobampo mexico on the 11th yorktown remained there until mid september for the remainder of 1913 yorktown conducted local operations out of san diego and san francisco in january 1914 though the gunboat returned to mexican waters and investigated local conditions at ensenada between 3 and 6 january of mexican ports mazatln san blas miramar topolobampo and la paz following an overhaul at mare island from 24 june to 2 september 1914 yorktown served in mexican waters again into june 1915 from that point until the entry of the united states into world war i in april 1917 yorktown continued her routine of patrols off mexican nicaraguan and honduran ports with occasional repairs at mare island and maneuvers out of san diego after the united states joined the allies yorktown operated off the coast of mexico until august 1917 when she paused briefly at san diego on 18 july 1917 yorktown rescued the last surviving members of an abandoned guano mining settlement on clipperton island from a peak population of roughly 100 in 1915 only four women and seven children survived after her time off the mexican coast yorktown then cruised off the west coasts of central and south yorktown sailed for the east coast on 28 april 1918 transiting the panama canal en route and arrived at new york on 20 august the gunboat escorted a coastal convoy to halifax soon there after before returning to new york she performed local coastwise escort duties through the end of world war i after a period of upkeep at the new york navy yard in december she departed the east coast

april 1918 was an english recipient of the victoria cross the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to british and commonwealth forces he was 38 years old and a lance corporal in the 8th battalion the queen s royal west surrey regiment british army during the first world war when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the vc on 21 march 1918 at le verguier france lance corporal sayer held the flank of a small isolated post for two hours owing to mist the enemy approached from both sides to within 30 yards before being discovered but the lance corporal on his own initiative without assistance beat off a succession of attacks inflicting heavy losses during the whole time he was exposed to heavy fire but his contempt of danger and skill in the use of his fire arms enabled the been killed and he himself wounded and captured he died as a result of wounds four weeks later sayer s actions on the day have been cited as having an immense effect on holding back the german offensive which stalled as they were held up by the queen s regiment defence embryoid bodies ebs are three dimensional aggregates of pluripotent stem cells the pluripotent cell types that comprise embryoid bodies include embryonic stem cells escs derived from the blastocyst stage of embryos from mouse mesc primate and human hesc sources additionally ebs can be formed from embryonic stem cells derived through alternative techniques including somatic cell nuclear transfer or the reprogramming of somatic cells to yield induced pluripotent stem cells ips similar to escs cultured in monolayer formats escs within embryoid bodies undergo differentiation and cell specification along the three germ lineages endoderm ectoderm and mesoderm which comprise all somatic cell types in contrast to monolayer cultures however the spheroid structures that are formed when escs aggregate enables the non adherent culture of ebs in suspension making eb cultures inherently scalable which is useful for bioprocessing approaches whereby large yields of cells can be produced for potential clinical applications additionally although ebs largely exhibit heterogeneous patterns of differentiated cell types escs are therefore the three dimensional structure including the establishment of complex cell adhesions and paracrine signaling within the eb microenvironment enables differentiation and morphogenesis which yields microtissues that are similar to native tissue structures such microtissues are promising to directly or indirectly repair damaged or diseased tissue in regenerative medicine applications as well as for in vitro testing in the pharmaceutical industry and as a model of embryonic development formation of ebs ebs are formed by the homophilic binding of the ca2 dependent adhesion molecule e cadherin which is highly expressed on undifferentiated escs when cultured as single cells in the absence of anti differentiation factors escs spontaneously aggregate to form ebs such spontaneous formation is often accomplished in bulk suspension cultures whereby the dish is coated with non adhesive materials such as agar or hydrophilic polymers to promote the preferential adhesion between single cells rather than to the culture substrate as hesc undergo apoptosis when cultured as single cells eb formation often necessitates the use of inhibitors of the rho associated kinase rock pathway thiazovivin tzv alternatively to avoid dissociation into single cells ebs can be formed from hescs by manual separation of adherent colonies or regions of colonies and subsequently cultured in suspension formation of ebs in suspension is amenable to the formation of large quantities of ebs but provides little control over the size of the resulting aggregates often leading to large irregularly shaped ebs as an alternative the hydrodynamic forces imparted in mixed culture platforms increase the homogeneity of eb sizes when escs are inoculated within bulk suspensions formation of ebs can also be more precisely controlled by the inoculation of known cell densities within single drops 10 20 l suspended from the lid of a petri dish known as hanging drops while this method enables control of eb size by altering the number of cells per drop the formation of hanging drops is labor intensive and not easily amenable to scalable cultures additionally the media can not be easily exchanged within the traditional hanging drop format necessitating the transfer of hanging drops into individual ebs tend to agglomerate recently new technologies have been developed to enable media exchange within a modified hanging drop format in addition technologies have also been developed to physically separate cells by forced aggregation of escs within individual wells or confined on adhesive substrates which enables increased throughput controlled formation of ebs ultimately the methods used for eb formation may impact the heterogeneity of eb populations in terms of aggregation kinetics eb size and yield as well as differentiation trajectories differentiation within ebs within the context of esc differentiation protocols eb formation is often used as a method for initiating spontaneous differentiation toward the three germ lineages eb differentiation begins with the specification of the exterior cells toward the primitive endoderm phenotype the cells at the exterior then deposit extracellular matrix ecm containing collagen iv and laminin similar to the composition and structure of basement membrane in response to the ecm deposition ebs often form a cystic cavity whereby the cells in contact with the basement resulting in a fluid filled cavity surrounded by cells subsequent differentiation proceeds to form derivatives of the three germ lineages in the absence of supplements the default differentiation of escs is largely toward ectoderm and subsequent neural lineages however alternative media compositions including the use of fetal bovine serum as well as defined growth factor additives have been developed to promote the differentiation toward mesoderm and endoderm lineages as a result of the three dimensional eb structure complex morphogenesis occurs during eb differentiation including the appearance of both epithelial and mesenchymal like cell populations as well as the appearance of markers associated with the epithelial mesenchymal transition emt additionally the inductive effects resulting from signaling between cell populations in ebs results in spatially and temporally defined changes which promote complex morphogenesis tissue like structures are often exhibited within ebs including the appearance of blood islands reminiscent of early blood vessel structures in the developing embryo as well as the patterning of neurite extensions indicative of neuron organization and spontaneous contractile activity indicative substrates such as gelatin more recently complex structures including optic cup like structures were created in vitro resulting from eb differentiation parallels with embryonic development much of the research central to embryonic stem cell differentiation and morphogenesis is derived from studies in developmental biology and mammalian embryogenesis for example immediately after the blastocyst stage of development from which escs are derived the embryo undergoes gastrulation whereby cell specification of the inner cell mass results in the formation of the visceral endoderm and epiblast as the anterior posterior axis is formed the embryo develops a transient structure known as the primitive streak much of the spatial patterning that occurs during the formation and migration of the primitive streak results from the secretion of agonists and antagonists by various cell populations including the growth factors from the wnt and transforming growth factor tgf families lefty 1 nodal as well as repressors of the same molecules dkk 1 sfrp1 sfrp5 due to the similarities between embryogenesis and esc differentiation differentiation approaches challenges to directing differentiation in ebs in contrast to the differentiation of escs in monolayer cultures whereby the addition of soluble morphogens and the extracellular microenvironment can be precisely and homogeneously controlled the three dimensional structure of ebs poses challenges to directed differentiation for example the visceral endoderm population which forms the exterior of ebs creates an exterior shell consisting of tightly connected epithelial like cells as well as a dense ecm due to such physical restrictions in combination with eb size transport limitations occur within ebs creating gradients of morphogens metabolites and nutrients it has been estimated that oxygen transport is limited in cell aggregates larger than approximately 300 m in diameter however the development of such gradients are also impacted by molecule size and cell uptake rates therefore the delivery of morphogens to ebs results in increased heterogeneity and decreased efficiency of differentiated cell populations compared to monolayer cultures one method of addressing transport limitations within ebs has been through polymeric delivery of morphogens from within the eb microtissues and subsequently assembled into larger structures for tissue engineering applications although the complexity resulting from the three dimensional adhesions and signaling may recapitulate more native tissue structures it also creates challenges for understanding the relative contributions of mechanical chemical and physical signals to the resulting cell phenotypes and morphogenesis impact of ethics and policy on eb research escs are the subject of much public debate due to the ethical questions arising from the derivation from blastocyst stage of development necessitating the destruction of the embryo although much early eb research was conducted using escs derived from mouse sources cell lines derived from human sources are necessary to fulfill the clinical promise of escs while current u s regulations initiated by the executive order of president barack obama in 2009 allow federal funding for hesc lines that are approved by the national institutes of health nih the derivation of new hesc lines using federal funding is prohibited by the dickey wicker amendment however due to the association of eb research with escs the long term outcomes of eb policy changes ebs however are amenable to the use of alternative pluripotent cell sources such as ips cells which holds promise for future applications in three dimensional stem cell differentiation ricardo lvarez rivn 16 722 ref born c 1950 is the creator of turey

an idea about a taino and his adventures turey el taino on october 26 1989 turey el taino published by editorial manos made its debut in the news and magazine stands in stores all over puerto rico turey el taino is what is known as a comic magazine instead of the regular comic format this comic comes in the form of a magazine it was first printed in black and white turey is a lovable turey goes on all kinds of adventures accompanied by his best friend batu the tribe witchdoctor baracutey and tureycito one his sons they either face the ferocious caribs or fight evil spirits the comic book is education oriented as it teaches how the tainos must have lived before the arrival of the spaniards the comic book also contains a section where the letters and drawings from the fans are published the first newspaper to publish the adventures of turey was el mundo of puerto rico soon the adventures of turey were being published in color in the sunday newspaper pages of el nuevo da recognitions

championship grands prix debuting on 18 may 1952 he won 3 races achieved 9 podiums and scored a total of 47 championship points early life and racing career peter collins was born on 6 november 1931 he grew up in mustow green on the south side of kidderminster in worcestershire united kingdom the son of a motor garage owner and haulage merchant collins became interested in motor vehicles at a young age at 16 he was expelled from school after having been caught riding dodgem cars at a local fairground during school hours becoming an apprentice in his fathers garage he soon began competing in local trials races in common with many british drivers of the immediate post war period collins cut his racing teeth in the frenetic 500cc category adopted as formula 3 at the end of 1950 when his parents bought these small machines powered by motorcycle engines were also the proving ground of many of collins f1 contemporaries notably including stirling moss later career collins joined the aston martin sports car team in 1952 and scored a sensational victory at the 1952 goodwood nine hours race the following year he took the aston martin db3s he shared with pat griffith to victory in the tourist trophy at dundrod collins got his formula one break in 1952 driving for the lowly hwm team replacing stirling moss results did not come the team s way and collins left after the 1953 season following spells driving for vanwall and maserati together with a brief outing in a brm which ended with a crash in qualifying collins signed with ferrari for the 1956 f1 season collins 1956 season with ferrari proved to be a turning point with a solid second place finish behind moss at monaco and wins at the belgian and french grands prix indeed collins was on the he handed his lancia ferrari d50 over to team leader juan manuel fangio after the latter suffered a steering arm failure toward the end of the italian grand prix at monza collins eventually finished second but the advantage handed to moss and the extra points gained by fangio s finish demoted collins to third place in the championship collins selfless act gained him respect from enzo ferrari and high praise from fangio i was moved almost to tears by the gesture peter was one of the finest and greatest gentlemen i ever met in my racing career in 1956 collins moved to monaco in order to avoid compulsory military service in the british army and thus continue his racing career in january 1957 collins married american actress louise king and the couple took up residence on a yacht in monaco harbour the same year collins was joined at ferrari by mike hawthorn the two became very close friends even arranging to split their winnings between each other and together engaged in a fierce rivalry with fellow ferrari at the nrburgring ferrari were distinctly under par for much of the season as the 801 model an evolution of the 1954 lancia d50 was overweight and underpowered 1958 saw the introduction of the new and improved ferrari dino 246 and once again results began to go the way of scuderia ferrari although achieving few results in the first half of the season collins improved and won the non championship international trophy however enzo ferrari felt collins was distracted by his supposed playboy lifestyle the monaco yacht where he lived was considered a perpetual party by ferrari who thought collins was distracted and no longer focused on driving and developing sports cars collins was sacked by ferrari after deliberately wrecking the clutch in his car that he shared with mike hawthorn during the le mans 24 hours rather than race in a rainstorm and was found drinking in a pub in england before the end of the race ferrari relented and allowed collins to drive an f2 car until the end of the season perhaps hoping to pacify hawthorn at rheims hawthorn refused to start unless collins was allowed to start in a f1 car he did and finished fifth ferrari immediately sacked collins again hawthorn responded by flying to italy and storming ferrari headquarters in modena having smashed down locked doors mike hawthorn told enzo ferrari he would never drive another race for him unless collins was given his formula one seat again ferrari perhaps sensibly relented at silverstone during the british grand prix collins responded with perhaps his greatest drive under team orders and his own wish to help his friend hawthorn win the championship collins led from the start running flat out and more at 11 10 in an effort to break the moss driven vanwall and in an inferior car to the main protagonists driving on the limit for 45 laps gradually pulling away from moss until his vanwall expired and collins won the ferrari team management decided not to slow collins down and flag hawthorn through to the win after collins great drive stirling s future patron found collins drive frightening and he should never drive like that again it was his third and final career victory that season he also took a third place at monaco death during the 1958 german grand prix at the nrburgring whilst chasing tony brooks vanwall disaster struck pushing hard to keep pace collins went into the pflanzgarten section of the circuit entered a turn too quickly causing his ferrari to run wide and strike a ditch on the left side of the road collins lost control and flipped into the air and landed upside down though collins was thrown clear as the car somersaulted he struck a tree sustaining critical head injuries despite being taken to hospital collins died later that afternoon his death was almost identical to the manner in which his ferrari team mate luigi musso died team mate mike hawthorn was so disturbed by collins death that he retired from racing immediately after winning the 1958 driver s championship hawthorn would himself die the following year near guildford rivalry with luigi musso many years after the death of peter collins fiamma breschi luigi musso s girlfriend at the time of his death revealed in a television documentary entitled the secret life of enzo ferrari the nature of the rivalry between team mates collins hawthorn and musso breschi recalled that the antagonism between musso and the two english drivers encouraged all three to take risks the englishmen hawthorn and collins had an agreement she says whichever of them won they would share the

weeks after his daughter regina also resigned from all her posts at the club regina casey regina was the club s financial controller since the club s formation in 2002 regina played a large role in ensuring the club was successful in its yearly application for a first division licence her father michael stated he was saddened recently to witness the resignation of regina from all the posts she held within the club regina dedicated an enormous amount of her time and skill to an extensive range of duties on behalf of the club in his own statement of resignation only two weeks after she had resigned dermot keely was appointed kildare county s first manager leading the club to 5th position in their maiden season keely had previously been in charge of shamrock rovers and dundalk shelbourne amongst others quite a lot of well known managers have served under longford town john gill dundalk pat fenlon shelbourne paul doolin drogheda united and pat scully shamrock rovers have all at one time or another served under dermot keely dermot keely was in charge of kildare county until 21 july 2003 when he resigned from the club to take over premier league outfit derry city keely had been previously in charge of shelbourne 19982002 guiding the club to two championships 19992000 and 200102 and one fai cup 2000 he also guided shels to victory over macedonian side sloga jugomagnat in the first round of 2000 01 champions league qualifiers under keely kildare county had played 47 games winning 21 drawing 12 and were defeated in 14 dermot was quoted as saying on his departure from the club that it had nothing to do with kildare county but that the chance to manage derry city was too big a chance to turn down i spent the whole weekend agonising over my decision and finally it came down to donegal and also the chance to manage at the highest level i have the greatest of respect for all at kildare county and wish them all the best in the future and i am sure that they will replace me and continue to go from strength to strength i have made a lot of good friends in kildare and it will the second result that i will be looking for every week dermot keely who had succeeded kevin mahon tenure at derry city was short however lasting less than a single season keely tendered his resignation to the board of directors stating that he did n t have what was required to secure the brandywell club s position in the top flight following a 2 0 defeat by ucd keely had failed to pick up a single victory in the league with the club s sole win in 12 games arriving in the fai cup third round 1 0 replay victory over cobh ramblers he took charge of dubin city in 2005 leading the club to promotion to the premier division before they subsequently folded in the middle it was the first time in the history of league of ireland football that a club had folded mid season due to financial reasons dermot keely blamed the eircom leagues move to summer football who is going to these summer soccer games on the hottest days of the year what crowds are we getting all of this has been done to help get some good results in europe but does that have to come at the cost of losing a club and was also quoted as saying that more dark days lie ahead keely returned to troubled club shelbourne as their new manager two weeks before the start of the 2007 season gavin dykes gavin dykes is best known for his eight seasons spent with sligo rovers dykes captained his home town club to an fai cup win in 1994 before moving to derry city winning a league title in 1997 dykes then moved to donegal based outfit finn harps playing there for three seasons and was also for player manager gavin dykes resigned as player manager of at the time the club in which he requested more money to strengthen the squad but was told that further cutbacks were required with the club already in real financial difficulty dykes resigned as manager and as a player at a time when the club were second from bottom of the eircom league premier division the club s situation worsened when the players at the club requested that they be placed on the transfer list on his arrival to station road gavin dykes established himself as a fan favourite and can probably lay claim to being the inspiration behind the first chant from the kildare supporters we love you dykesy cos youve got grey hair we love you dykesy cos your everywhere dykes further proved his popularity amongst kildare supporters when he picked up the first ever kildare county supporters club player of the month in october a serious back injury led to dykes retiring from playing in 2003 after almost 400 eircom league games he was then installed as assistant manager to dermot keely gavin dykes became the new manager of dermot keely dykes resigned on 29 may 2004 shaking hands with his players in the dressing room before leavibg derry city with the club at the time lying two points off the bottom of the eircom premier division it was ironic that dykes s reign ended against drogheda united as drogheda united were also the opposition that dykes had faced in his first game in charge gavin dykes was also assistant manager at newry town for two years he holds a uefa a licence and is currently manager of castlebar celtic and was named mayo manager of the year for 2006 he managed both the senior team and castlebar celtics eircom league under 21 team for the 2007 2008 season he stepped down as manager of both teams before the start of the 2008 2009 season john gill john gill had started out in football as a player at drogheda united where he spent most of his playing career he did play for other clubs including kilkenny city bray wanderers and sligo rovers john gill s debut in management was with dublin s assistant manager at kilkenny city before taking up the same role alongside dermot keely at newly formed kildare county f c in 2002 his stay at kildare was short however and he took over dublin city in 2003 leading the club to the premier division gill resigned the following season however after a poor start in the league and a subsequent defeat by division one outfit monaghan united in the second round of the fai cup gill did not re enter football management until the second half of the 2005 season with athlone town he moved to dundalk the following season leading the club to second in division one under normal circumstances the club would have entered a play off with the premier division team who had finished in second last position that season however the league was undergoing a reformation at the time and despite fulfilling this fixture and beating waterford united the club were not allowed to enter the premier division due to the failure of the club to meet other criteria gill has remained in charge for the 2007 season and end of the 2009 season he guided dundalk to the first division title in the 2008 season the decisive game was ironically played at kildare county with dundalk requiring a win and limerick 37 drawing or defeating title rivals and dermot keeley managed shelbounre john gills manager at kildare county in their maiden season while dundalk won it was n t until the very end of the game that the dundalk faithful could celebrate as shelbourne had been leading in their fixture until the closing stages conceding a late equaliser he resigned from dundalk shortly afterwards eric hannigan eric hannigan was appointed kildare county s new manager after the departure of dermot keely and gavin dykes in 2003 hannigan who is from kildare was viewed by

manager martin murray he is a former shamrock rovers and shelbourne player eric hannigan hannigan is probably best known for his exploits at junior level ashtownvilla he was a member of the

persistent state world psw is one where the world is persistent meaning the world ideally continues to exist even after users have exited the world and that changes made to the world state by its users remain intact the term is frequently used in definitions of virtual worlds massively multiplayer online role playing games mmorpgs and in conjunction with pervasive games having gained popularity with the rise of mmorpgs the concept of world persistence should not be confused with similar persistence concepts such as persistent network connectivity or data persistence overview a persistent world can be achieved by developing and maintaining a single or dynamic instance state of the game world that is shared and viewed by all players around the clock quite unlike other types of games the plot and events in a persistent world game continue to develop even while some of the players are not playing their characters the real world is persistent always available and where changes made by a particular person remain can speak of physical persistence where the game world is persistent in the physical world to give the illusion that the game world is always available persistent worlds can be simulated this can be achieved by scheduling when players are allowed to play around times when the world is offline or as in the animal crossing series having the game generate events that could have happened during the period of inactivity aside from virtual worlds the simulation of a persistent world is also possible in single player games in noctis players are advised to turn off the game while refueling because it takes so long in addition if a player who has landed on a planet stops playing and then after a while resumes he or she can see visible changes

has been a jewish presence in france since at least the early middle ages france was once a center of jewish learning but persecution increased as the middle ages wore on france was the first country in europe to emancipate its jewish population during the french revolution but despite legal equality antisemitism remained an issue as illustrated in the dreyfus affair of the late 19th century france has the largest jewish population by country today french jews are mostly sephardi and mizrahi who came from north africa and the mediterranean region and span a range of religious affiliations from the ultra orthodox haredi communities to the large segment of jews who are entirely secular roman gallic epoch according to the jewish encyclopedia 1906 the first settlements of jews in europe are obscure from 163 b c e there is evidence of jews in rome in the year 6 c e there were jews at vienne and gallia lyon further documents indicating the presence of jews in france before the fourth century are as yet unknown hilary of poitiers died 366 is praised for having fled from the jewish society a decree of the emperors theodosius ii and valentinian iii addressed to amatius prefect of gaul 9 july 425 prohibited jews and pagans from practising law and from holding public offices militandi in order that christians should not be in subjection to them and thus be incited to change their faith at the funeral of hilary bishop of arles in 449 jews and christians mingled in crowds and wept while the former sang psalms in hebrew from the year 465 the church took official cognizance of the jews jews were found in marseille in the sixth century at arles at uzs at narbonne at clermont ferrand at orlans at paris and at bordeaux these places were generally centers of roman administration located on the great commercial routes and theodosian code and according to an edict addressed in 331 to the decurions of cologne by the emperor constantine the internal organization of the jews seems to have been the same as in the roman empire they appear to have had priests rabbis or azzanim archisynagogues patersynagogues and other synagogue officials the jews were principally merchants they were also tax collectors sailors and physicians they probably remained under the roman law until the triumph of christianity with the status established by caracalla on a footing of equality with their fellow citizens the emperor constantius 321 compelled them to share in the curia a heavy burden imposed on citizens of townships there is nothing to show that their association with their fellow citizens was not of an amicable nature even after the establishment of christianity in gaul it is known that the christian clergy participated in their feasts intermarriage between jews and christians sometimes occurred the jews made proselytes and their religious customs were so freely adopted that was found necessary to warn the faithful against jewish superstitions and to order them to abstain from traveling on sunday and from adorning their persons or dwellings on that day in the 6th century a jewish community thrived in paris a synagogue was built on the ile de la cite but was later torn down and a church was erected instead in 629 king dagobert proposed to drive from his domains all jews who would not accept christianity from his reign to that of pepin the short no further mention of the jews is found but in the south of france which was then known as septimania and was a dependency of the visigothic kings of spain the jews continued to dwell and to prosper from this epoch 689 dates the earliest known jewish inscription relating to france that of narbonne the jews of narbonne chiefly merchants were popular among the people who often rebelled against the visigothic kings carolingian period the presence of jews in france under charlemagne is exchanges with the orient strongly declined with the presence of saracens in the mediterranean sea while oriental products such as gold silk black pepper or papyrus almost disappeared under the carolingians the only real link between the orient and occident was insured by the radhanites jewish traders a formula for the jewish oath was fixed by charlemagne and jews were allowed to enter into lawsuits with christians and in their relations with the latter were restrained only from making them work on sunday jews were not allowed to trade in currency wine or grain legally jews belonged to the emperor and could only be tried by him among the numerous provincial councils which met during charlemagne s reign not one concerned itself with the jewish community although these had increased in number louis le dbonnaire 814833 faithful to the principles of his father granted strict protection to jews to whom he gave special attention in their position as merchants jews were engaged in export trade an instance of go to palestine and bring back precious merchandise furthermore when the normans disembarked on the coast of narbonnese gaul they were taken for jewish merchants they boast says one authority of buying whatever they please from bishops and abbots isaac the jew who was sent by charlemagne in 797 with two ambassadors to harun al rashid the fifth abbasid caliph was probably one of these merchants in the same spirit as in the above mentioned legends he is represented as asking the baghdad calif for a rabbi to instruct the jews whom he had allowed to settle at narbonne see history of the jews in babylonia middle ages expert july 2011 persecutions under the capets 9871137 there were widespread persecutions of jews in france beginning in 1007 or 1009 these persecutions instigated by robert ii 9721031 king of france 9871031 called the pious are described in a hebrew pamphlet which also states that the king of france conspired with his vassals to destroy baptism and many were put to death or killed themselves robert is credited with advocating forced conversions of local jewry as well as mob violence against jews who refused among the martyrs was the learned rabbi senior robert the pious is well known for his lack of religious toleration and for the hatred which he bore toward heretics it was robert who reinstated the roman imperial custom of burning heretics at the stake in normandy under richard ii duke of normandy rouen jewry suffered from persecutions that were so terrible that many women in order to escape the fury of the mob jumped into the river and drowned a notable of the town jacob b jekuthiel a talmudic scholar sought to intercede with pope john xviii to stop the persecutions in lorraine 1007 jacob undertook the journey to rome but was imprisoned with his wife and four sons by duke richard and escaped death only by a miracle he left his eldest son judah as a hostage sons went to rome he made a present of seven gold marks and two hundred pounds to the pope who thereupon sent a special envoy to king robert ordering him to stop the persecutions if adhmar of chabannes who wrote in 1030 is to be believed he had a reputation as a fabricator the anti jewish feelings arose in 1010 after western jews addressed a letter to their eastern coreligionists warning them of a military movement against the saracens according to admar christians urged by pope sergius iv were shocked by the destruction by the muslims in 1009 of the church of the holy sepulcher after the destruction european reaction to the rumor of the letter was of shock and dismay cluniac monk rodulfus glaber blamed the jews for the destruction in that year alduin bishop of limoges bishop 990 1012 offered the jews of his diocese the choice between baptism and exile for a month theologians held disputations with the jews but without much success for only three or four of the rest either fled or were expelled from limoges similar expulsions took place in other french towns by 1030 rodulfus glaber knew more concerning this story according to his 1030 explanation jews of orlans had sent to the east through a beggar a letter which provoked the order for the destruction of the church of the holy sepulcher glaber adds that on the discovery of the crime the expulsion of the jews was everywhere decreed some were driven out of the cities others were put to death while some killed themselves only a few remained in all the roman world count paul riant 1836 1888 says that this whole story of the relations between the jews and the mohammedans is only one of those popular legends with which the chronicles of the time abound another violent commotion arose about 1065 at this date pope alexander ii wrote to branger viscount of narbonne and to guifred bishop of the city praising them for having prevented the massacre of the jews in their district the shedding of blood in 1065 also alexander admonished landulf vi of benevento that the conversion of jews is not to be obtained by force also in the same year alexander called for a crusade against the moors in spain these crusaders killed without mercy all the jews whom they met on their route franco jewish literature during this period which continues until the first crusade also saw the awakening of jewish culture in the south and north of france the initial interest included poetry which was at times purely liturgical but which more often was a simple scholastic exercise without aspiration destined rather to amuse and instruct than to move following this came biblical exegesis the simple interpretation of the text with neither daring nor depth reflecting a complete faith in traditional interpretation and based by preference upon the midrashim despite their fantastic character finally and above all their attention was occupied with the talmud and its commentaries the text of the geonim particularly their responsa was first revised and copied then these writings were treated as a corpus juris and were commented upon and studied both as a pious exercise in dialectics and from the practical point of view there was no philosophy no natural science no belles lettres among the french jews of this period rashi the great jewish figure which dominated the second half of the 11th century as well as the whole rabbinical history of france was rabbi rashi rabbi shlomo yitzchaki of troyes 10401106 he personified the genius of northern french judaism its devoted attachment to tradition its untroubled faith its piety ardent but free from mysticism his works are distinguished by their clarity directness and are written in a simple concise unaffected style suited to his subject his commentary on the talmud which was the product of colossal labor and by its clarity and soundness made easy the study of that vast compilation and soon become its indispensable complement every edition of the talmud that was ever published has this commentary printed on the same page of the talmud itself his commentary on the bible particularly on the pentateuch a sort of repertory of the midrash served for edification but also advanced the taste for seeking the plain and true meaning of the bible the school which he founded at troyes his birthplace after having followed the teachings of those of worms germany the crusades the jews of france suffered during the first crusade 1096 when the crusaders are stated for example to have shut up the jews of rouen in a church and to have murdered them without distinction of age or sex sparing only those who accepted baptism according to a hebrew document the jews throughout france were at that time in great fear and wrote to their brothers in the rhine to fast and pray in the rhineland thousands of jews were killed by the crusaders see german crusade 1096 expulsions and returns expulsion from france 1182 the first crusade led to nearly a century of accusations blood libel against the jews many of whom were burned or attacked in france immediately after the coronation of philip augustus on 14 march 1181 the king ordered the jews arrested on a saturday in all their synagogues and despoiled of their money and their investments in the following april 1182 he published an edict of expulsion but according the jews a delay of three months for the sale of their personal property immovable property however such as houses fields vines barns and wine presses he confiscated the jews attempted to win over the nobles to their side but in vain in july they were compelled to leave the royal domains of france and not the whole kingdom their synagogues were converted fill the royal coffers the goods confiscated by the king were at once converted into cash during the century which terminated so disastrously for the jews their condition was not altogether bad especially if compared with that of their brethren in germany thus may be explained the remarkable intellectual activity which existed among them the attraction which it exercised over the jews of other countries and the numerous works produced in those days the impulse given by rashi to study did not cease with his death his successorsthe members of his family first among thembrilliantly continued his work research moved within the same limits as in the preceding century and dealt mainly with the talmud rabbinical jurisprudence and biblical exegesis recalled by philip augustus 1198 this century which opened with the return of the jews to france proper then reduced almost to the isle of france closed with their complete exile from the country in a larger sense in july 1198 philip augustus contrary to the general expectation paris and made the churches of god suffer great persecutions rigord the king adopted this measure from no good will toward the jews for he had shown his true sentiments a short time before in the bray affair but since then he had learned that the jews could be an excellent source of income from a fiscal point of view especially as money lenders not only did he recall them to his estates but he gave state sanction by his ordinances to their operations in banking and pawnbroking he placed their business under control determined the legal rate of interest and obliged them to have seals affixed to all their deeds naturally this trade was taxed and the affixing of the royal seal was paid for by the jews henceforward there was in the treasury a special account called produit des juifs and the receipts from this source increased continually at the same time it was to the interest of the treasury to secure possession of the jews considered as a fiscal resource the royal domain just at a time when the charters becoming wider and wider tended to bring about the disappearance of serfdom in certain respects their position became even harder than that of serfs for the latter could in certain cases appeal to custom and were often protected by the church but there was no custom to which the jews might appeal and the church laid them under its ban the kings and the lords said my jews just as they said my lands and they disposed in like manner of the one and of the other the lords imitated the king they endeavored to have the jews considered an inalienable dependence of their fiefs and to establish the usage that if a jew domiciled in one barony passed into another the lord of his former domicil should have the right to seize his possessions this agreement was made in 1198 between the king and the count of champagne in a treaty the terms of which provided that neither should retain in his domains the jews of that the jews should not make loans or receive pledges without the express permission of the king and the count other lords made similar conventions with the king thenceforth they too had a revenue known as the produit des juifs comprising the taille or annual quit rent the legal fees for the writs necessitated by the jews law trials and the seal duty a thoroughly characteristic feature of this fiscal policy is that the bishops according to the agreement of 1204 regulating the spheres of ecclesiastical and seigniorial jurisdiction continued to prohibit the clergy from excommunicating those who sold goods to the jews or who bought from them the practice of retention treaties spread throughout france after 1198 lords intending to impose a heavy tax captio literally capture on jews living in their lordship dominium signed treaties with their neighbours whereby the latter refused to permit the former s jews entry into his domains thus retaining them for the lord to flight of jews in the face of a captio to a different dominium where they purchased the right to settle unmolested by gifts bribes to their new lord in may 1210 the crown negotiated a series of treaties with the neighbours of the royal demesne and successfully captured its jews with a large tax levy from 1223 on however the count palatine of champagne refused to sign any such treaties and in that year even refused to affirm the crown s asserted right to force non retention policies on its barons such treaties became obsolete after louis ix s ordinance of melun 1230 when it became illegal for a jew migrate between lordships this ordinancethe first piece of public legislation in france since carolingian timesalso declared it treason to refuse non retention under louis viii louis viii of france 122326 in his etablissement sur les juifs of 1223 while more inspired with the doctrines of the church than his father philip augustus his treasury although he declared that from 8 november 1223 the interest on jews debts should no longer hold good he at the same time ordered that the capital should be repaid to the jews in three years and that the debts due the jews should be inscribed and placed under the control of their lords the lords then collected the debts for the jews doubtless receiving a commission louis furthermore ordered that the special seal for jewish deeds should be abolished and replaced by the ordinary one twenty six barons accepted louis viii s new measures but theobald iv 120153 the powerful count of champagne did not since he had an agreement with the jews that guaranteed their safety in return for extra income through taxation champagne s capital at troyes was where rashi had lived a century before and champagne continued to have a prosperous jewish population theobald iv would become a major opposition force to capetian dominance and his hostility was manifest during the reign of louis viii for example the minimum service of 40 days and left home amid charges of treachery under louis ix in spite of all these restrictions designed to restrain if not to suppress money lending louis ix of france 122670 with his ardent piety and his submission to the church unreservedly condemned loans at interest he was less amenable than philip augustus to fiscal considerations despite former conventions in an assembly held at melun in december 1230 he compelled several lords to sign an agreement not to authorize jews to make any loan no one in the whole kingdom was allowed to detain a jew belonging to another and each lord might recover a jew who belonged to him just as he might his own serf tanquam proprium servum wherever he might find him and however long a period had elapsed since the jew had settled elsewhere at the same time the ordinance of 1223 was enacted afresh which only proves that it had not been carried into effect jews in 1234 louis freed his subjects from a third of their registered debts to jews including those who had already paid their debts but debtors had to pay the remaining two thirds within a specified time it was also forbidden to imprison christians or to sell their real estate to recover debts owed to jews the king wished in this way to strike a deadly blow at usury in 1243 louis ordered at the urging of pope gregory ix the burning in paris of some 12 000 manuscript copies of the talmud and other jewish books in order to finance his first crusade louis ordered the expulsion of all jews engaged in usury and the confiscation of their property for use in his crusade but the order for the expulsion was only partly enforced if at all louis left for the seventh crusade in 1248 however he did not cancel the debts owed by christians later louis became conscience stricken and overcome by scruples he feared lest the treasury by might be enriched with the product of usury as a result one third of the debts was forgiven but the other two thirds was to be remitted to the royal treasury in 1251 while louis was in captivity on the crusade a popular movement rose up with the intention of traveling to the east to rescue him although they never made it out of northern france jews were subject to their attacks as they wandered throughout the country see shepherds crusade in 1257 or 1258 ordonnances i 85 wishing as he says to provide for his safety of soul and peace of conscience louis issued a mandate for the restitution in his name of the amount of usurious interest which had been collected on the confiscated property the restitution to be made either to those who had paid it or to their heirs later after having discussed the subject with his son in law thibaut king of navarre and count of champagne louis decided on 13 september 1268 to which followed close upon this last 1269 shows that on this occasion also louis reconsidered the matter nevertheless at the request of paul christian pablo christiani he compelled the jews under penalty of a fine to wear at all times the rouelle or badge decreed by the fourth lateran council in 1215 this consisted of a piece of red felt or cloth cut in the form of a wheel four fingers in circumference which had to be attached to the outer garment at the chest and back the medieval inquisition the inquisition which had been instituted in order to suppress the heresy of the albigenses finally occupied itself with the jews of southern france who converted to christianity the popes complained that not only were baptized jews returning to their former faith but that christians also were being converted to judaism in march 1273 gregory x formulated the following rules relapsed jews as well as christians who abjured their faith in favor the inquisitors as heretics the instigators of such apostasies as those who received or defended the guilty ones were to be punished in the same way as the delinquents in accordance with these rules the jews of toulouse who had buried a christian convert in their cemetery were brought before the inquisition in 1278 for trial with their rabbi isaac males being condemned to the stake philip the fair as mentioned above at first ordered his seneschals not to imprison any jews at the instance of the inquisitors but in 1299 he rescinded this order the great exile of 1306 toward the middle of 1306 the treasury was nearly empty and the king as he was about to do the following year in the case of the templars condemned the jews to banishment and took forcible possession of their property real and personal their houses lands and movable goods were sold at auction and for the king were reserved any treasures found buried in the the fair intended merely to fill the gap in his treasury and was not at all concerned about the well being of his subjects is shown by the fact that he put himself in the place of the jewish moneylenders and exacted from their christian debtors the payment of their debts which they themselves had to declare furthermore three months before the sale of the property of the jews the king took measures to ensure that this event should be coincident with the prohibition of clipped money in order that those who purchased the goods should have to pay in undebased coin finally fearing that the jews might have hidden some of their treasures he declared that one fifth of any amount found should be paid to the discoverer it was on 22 july the day after tisha b av a jewish fast day that the jews were arrested in prison they received notice that they had been sentenced to exile that abandoning their goods and debts and taking only the clothes which sous tournois each they would have to quit the kingdom within one month speaking of this exile an american rabbi has said in striking at the jews philip the fair at the same time dried up one of the most fruitful sources of the financial commercial and industrial prosperity of his kingdom although the history of the jews of france in a way began its course again a short time afterward it may be said that in reality it ceased at this date it was specially sad for them that during the preceding century the domaine of the list of french monarchs return of the jews to france 1315 nine years had hardly passed since the expulsion of 1306 when louis x of france 131416 recalled the jews in an edict dated 28 july 1315 he permitted them to return for a period of twelve years authorizing them to establish themselves in the cities in which they had lived before their banishment the people geoffrey of paris the popular poet of the time says in fact that the jews were gentle in comparison with the christians who had taken their place and who had flayed their debtors alive if the jews had remained the country would have been happier for there were no longer any moneylenders at all bouquet xxii 118 the king probably had the interests of his treasury also in view the profits of the former confiscations had gone into the treasury and by recalling the jews for only twelve years he would have an opportunity for ransoming them at the end of this period it appears that they gave the sum of 122 500 livres for the privilege of returning it is also probable as adolphe vuitry states that a large number of the debts owing to the jews had not been recovered and that the holders of the notes had preserved them the decree of return specified that two thirds of the old debts recovered by the jews they were allowed to settle in the land are set forth in a number of articles some of the guaranties which were accorded the jews had probably been demanded by them and been paid for they were to live by the work of their hands or to sell merchandise of a good quality they were to wear the circular badge and not discuss religion with laymen they were not to be molested either with regard to the chattels they had carried away at the time of their banishment or with regard to the loans which they had made since then or in general with regard to anything which had happened in the past their synagogues and their cemeteries were to be restored to them on condition that they would refund their value or if these could not be restored the king would give them the necessary sites at a reasonable price the books of the law that had not yet been returned to them were also to be restored with the exception of the talmud after might not expel the jews again without giving them a year s time in which to dispose of their property and carry away their goods they were not to lend on usury and no one was to be forced by the king or his officers to repay to them usurious loans if they engaged in pawnbroking they were not to take more than two deniers in the pound a week they were to lend only on pledges two men with the title auditors of the jews were entrusted with the execution of this ordinance and were to take cognizance of all claims that might arise in connection with goods belonging to the jews which had been sold before the expulsion for less than half of what was regarded as a fair price the king finally declared that he took the jews under his special protection and that he desired to have their persons and property protected from all violence injury and oppression expulsion of 1394 on 17 september 1394 charles vi also known as charles declared in substance that for a long time he had been taking note of the many complaints provoked by the excesses and misdemeanors which the jews committed against christians and that the prosecutors having made several investigations had discovered many violations by the jews of the agreement they had made with him therefore he decreed as an irrevocable law and statute that thenceforth no jew should dwell in his domains ordonnances vii 675 according to the religieux de st denis the king signed this decree at the instance of the queen chron de charles vi ii 119 the decree was not immediately enforced a respite being granted to the jews in order that they might sell their property and pay their debts those indebted to them were enjoined to redeem their obligations within a set time otherwise their pledges held in pawn were to be sold by the jews the provost was to escort the jews to the frontier of the kingdom subsequently the king released the christians from discovered of a jewish presence in provence since at least the 1st century the earliest documentary evidence for the presence of jews dates from the middle of the 5th century in arles the jewish presence reached a peak in 1348 when it probably numbered about 15 000 provence was not incorporated into france until 1481 and the expulsion edict of 1394 did not apply there the privileges of the jews of provence were confirmed in 1482 however from 1484 anti jewish disturbances broke out with looting and violence perpetrated by laborers from outside the region hired for the harvest season in some places jews were protected by the town officials and they were declared to be under royal protection however a voluntary exodus began and was accelerated when similar disorders were repeated in 1485 according to isidore loeb in a special study of the subject in the revue des tudes juives xiv 162183 about 3 000 jews came to provence after the alhambra decree expelled jews from spain in 1492 for expulsion but the calls were rejected by charles viii however louis xii in one of his first acts as king in 1498 issued a general expulsion order of the jews of provence though not enforced at the time the order was renewed in 1500 and again in 1501 on this occasion it was definitively implemented the jews of provence were given the option of conversion to christianity and a number chose that option however after a short while if only to compensate partially for the loss of revenues caused by the departure of the jews the king imposed a special tax referred to as the tax of the neophytes these converts and their descendants soon became the objects of social discrimination and slanders during the second half of the 17th century a number of jews attempted to reestablish themselves in provence before the french revolution abolished the administrative entity of provence the first community outside the southwest alsace lorraine and comtat venaissin was re formed in marseilles early modern period century jews began again to re enter france this resulted in a new edict of 23 april 1615 which forbade christians under the penalty of death and confiscation to shelter jews or to converse with them alsace and lorraine were the home of a significant number of jews in annexing the provinces in 1648 louis xiv was at first inclined toward the banishment of jews living in those provinces but thought better of it in view of the benefit he could derive from them on 25 september 1675 he granted these jews letters patent taking them under his special protection this however did not prevent them from being subjected to every kind of extortion and their position remained the same as it had been under the austrian government the regency was no less severe in 1683 louis xiv expelled jews from the newly acquired colony of martinique beginnings of emancipation by the 1780s there were about 40 000 to 50 000 jews in france chiefly centered in bordeaux metz and a few other apart from the money lending business but their status was not illegal in the course of the 18th century the attitude of the authorities toward jews changed for the better a spirit of tolerance began to prevail which corrected the iniquities of previous legislation the authorities often overlooked infractions of the edict of banishment a colony of portuguese and german jews was tolerated in paris the voices of enlightened christians who demanded justice for the proscribed people began to be heard an alsatian jew named cerf berr who had rendered great service to the french government as purveyor to the army was the interpreter of the jews before louis xvi the humane minister malesherbes summoned a commission of jewish notables to make suggestions for the amelioration of the condition of their coreligionists the direct result of the efforts of these men was the abolition in 1785 of the degrading poll tax and the permission to settle in all parts of france shortly afterward the jewish question was raised by two men of genius who abb grgoirethe former of whom while on a diplomatic mission in prussia had made the acquaintance of moses mendelssohn and his school see haskalah who were then working toward the intellectual emancipation of the jews in a pamphlet sur moses mendelssohn sur la rforme politique des juifs london 1787 mirabeau refuted the arguments of the german antisemites like michaelis and claimed for the jews the full rights of citizenship this pamphlet naturally provoked many writings for and against the jews and the french public became interested in the question on the proposition of roederer the royal society of science and arts of metz offered a prize for the best essay in answer to the question what are the best means to make the jews happier and more useful in france nine essays of which only two were unfavorable to the jews were submitted to the judgment of the learned assembly of the challenge there were three winners abb gregoire claude antoine jews in bordeaux and bayonne participated in 1789 to the election of the estates general but those in alsace lorraine and in paris were denied this right cerf beer then asked to jacques necker and obtained the right for jews from eastern france to elect their own delegates among them were the son of cerf beer theodore and joseph david sinzheim the cahier written by the jewish community from eastern france asked for the end of the discriminatory status and taxes targeting jews the fall of the bastille was the signal for disorders everywhere in france in certain districts of alsace the peasants attacked the dwellings of the jews who took refuge in basel a gloomy picture of the outrages upon them was sketched before the national assembly 3 august by the abb henri grgoire who demanded their complete emancipation the national assembly shared the indignation of the prelate but left undecided the question of emancipation it was intimidated by the deputies of alsace especially by jean franois rewbell on 22 december 1789 the issue of admitting to public service all citizens without distinction of creed mirabeau the abb grgoire robespierre duport barnave and the comte de clermont tonnerre exerted all the power of their eloquence to bring about the desired emancipation but the repeated disturbances in alsace and the strong opposition of the deputies of that province and of the clericals like la fare bishop of nancy the abb maury and others caused the decision to be again postponed only the portuguese and the avignonese jews who had hitherto enjoyed all civil rights as naturalized frenchmen were declared full citizens by a majority of 150 on 28 january 1790 this partial victory infused new hope into the jews of the german districts who made still greater efforts in the struggle for freedom they won over the eloquent advocate godard whose influence in revolutionary circles was considerable through his exertions the national guards and the diverse sections pronounced themselves in favor of the jews and the abb malot was sent by the general assembly of unfortunately the grave affairs which absorbed the assembly the prolonged agitations in alsace and the passions of the clerical party kept in check the active propaganda of the jews and their friends a few days before the dissolution of the national assembly 27 september 1791 a member of the jacobin club formerly a parliamentary councilor duport unexpectedly ascended the tribune and said i believe that freedom of worship does not permit any distinction in the political rights of citizens on account of their creed the question of the political existence of the jews has been postponed still the muslems and the men of all sects are admitted to enjoy political rights in france i demand that the motion for postponement be withdrawn and a decree passed that the jews in france enjoy the privileges of full citizens this proposition was accepted amid loud applause rewbell endeavored indeed to oppose the motion but he was interrupted by regnault de saint jean president of the assembly who suggested that every one because he would be opposing the constitution itself during the reign of terror judaism in france thus became as the alsatian deputy schwendt wrote to his constituents nothing more than the name of a distinct religion however in alsace especially in the bas rhin the reactionaries did not cease their agitations and jews were victims of discriminations during the reign of terror at bordeaux jewish bankers compromised in the cause of the girondins had to pay important fines or to run away to save their lives while some jewish bankers 49 according to the jewish encyclopedia were imprisoned at paris as suspects and nine of them were executed the decree of the convention by which the catholic faith was annulled and replaced by the worship of reason was applied by the provincial clubs especially by those of the german districts to the jewish religion as well some synagogues were pillaged and the mayors of a few eastern towns strasbourg troyes etc forbade the celebration of sabbath to french jews gave proofs of their patriotism and of their gratitude to the land which had emancipated them many of them died in battle as part of the army of the republic while fighting the forces of europe in coalition to contribute to the war fund candelabra of synagogues were sold and many jews deprived themselves of their jewels to make similar contributions attitude of napoleon though the revolution had begun the process of jewish emancipation in france napoleon also spread the concept in the lands he conquered across europe liberating jews from their ghettos and establishing relative equality for them the net effect of his policies significantly changed the position of the jews in europe starting in 1806 napoleon passed a number of measures supporting the position of the jews in the french empire including assembling a representative group elected by the jewish community the grand sanhedrin in conquered countries he abolished laws restricting jews to ghettos in 1807 he added judaism as an official religion of france with previously sanctioned the positive effects it is unclear however whether napoleon himself was disposed favorably towards the jews or merely saw them as a political or financial tool on 17 march 1808 napoleon rolled back some reforms by the so called dcret infme declaring all debts with jews reduced postponed or annulled this caused the jewish community to nearly collapse the decree also restricted where jews could live especially for those in the eastern french empire with all its annexations in the rhineland and beyond as of 1810 in hopes of assimilating them into society many of these restrictions were eased again in 1811 and finally abolished in 1818 after the restoration the restoration of louis xviii did not bring any change in the political condition of the jews such of the enemies of the jews as cherished the hope that the bourbons would hasten to undo the work of the revolution with regard to jewish emancipation were soon disappointed the emancipation the french jews had made such progress that curtailing their rights as citizens they were no longer poor downtrodden peddlers or money lenders with whom every petty official could do as he liked many of them already occupied high positions in the army and the magistracy as well as in the arts and sciences state recognition of the faiths recognized by the state only the jewish had to support its ministers while those of the catholic and protestant churches were supported by the government this legal inferiority was removed in that year thanks to the intervention of the duke of orlans lieutenant general of the kingdom and to the campaign led in parliament by the deputies rambuteau and viennet encouraged by these prominent men the minister of education on 13 november 1830 offered a motion to place judaism upon an equal footing with catholicism and protestantism as regards support for the synagogues and for the rabbis from the public treasury the motion was accompanied by flattering compliments to the french jews who said the minister since the removal of their the privileges granted them after a short discussion the motion was adopted by a large majority in january 1831 it passed in the chamber of peers by 89 votes to 57 and on 8 february it was ratified by king louis philippe who from the beginning had shown himself favorable to placing judaism on an equal footing with the other faiths shortly afterward the rabbinical college which had been founded at metz in 1829 was recognized as a state institution and was granted a subsidy the government likewise liquidated the debts contracted by various jewish communities before the revolution assimilation while the jews had been placed in every point the equals of their christian fellow citizens the oath more judaico still continued to be administered to them in spite of the repeated protestations of the rabbis and the consistory it was only in 1846 owing to a brilliant speech of the jewish advocate adolphe crmieux pronounced before the court of nmes in defense of a rabbi who had refused on the subject by martin a prominent christian advocate of strasburg that the court of cassation removed this last remnant of the legislation of the middle ages with this act of justice the history of the jews of france merges into the general history of the french people the rapidity with which many of them won affluence and distinction in the nineteenth century is without parallel in spite of the deep rooted prejudices which prevailed in certain classes of french society many of them occupied high positions in literature art science jurisprudence the armyindeed in every walk of life in 1860 the alliance israelite universelle was formed to work everywhere for the emancipation and moral progress of the jews to offer effective assistance to jews suffering from antisemitism and to encourage all publications calculated to promote this aim in 1870 the approximate 40 000 jews of algeria at that time a french department were automatically granted french citizenship by the crmieux decrees people of the jewish after their emancipation in 1791 jews in france had new freedoms for example jews were allowed to attend schools that were once delegated for just non jews they were also allowed to pray in their own synagogues lastly many jews found themselves moving from the rural areas of france and into the big cities in these big cities jews had new job opportunities and many were advancing up the economic ladder although life was looking brighter for these western jews some jews who lived in eastern europe believed that the emancipation in western countries were causing the jews to lose their traditional beliefs and culture as more and more jews were becoming assimilated into their new lives these jews were breaking away from rabbinical law and rabbinical authority decreased for example jews were marrying outside of their religion and their children were growing up in homes where they were not being introduced to traditional beliefs and losing connection with their roots also in these new urbanized jewish homes less and less jews were following the preoccupied with assimilating and prospering in their new lives that they formed a new type of judaism that would fit with the times the reform movement came about to let jews stay connected to their roots while also living their lives without so many restrictions in the last decade of the nineteenth century the reactionaries having failed in every attempt to overthrow the republic had recourse to antisemitism by means of which they maintained a persistent agitation for over ten years the jews were charged with the ruin of the country and with all the crimes which the fertile imagination of a drumont founder of the antisemitic league of france or a viau could invent and as the accused often disdained to answer such slanderous attacks the charges were believed by a great number of people to be true a campaign was started against jewish army officers which culminated in the dreyfus affair during which a jewish officer alfred dreyfus was accused of treason in favour of the german empire and jailed in appalling conditions at the turn of the century the 1905 law on the separation of the church and the state put an end to state religion in france all religions and philosophies being considered by the state a matter of privacy tolerance and of freedom of thought 20th century dreyfus affair the dreyfus affair was a major political scandal that convulsed france from 1894 until its resolution in 1906 and then had reverberations for decades more the affair is often seen as a modern and universal symbol of injustice for reasons of state and remains one of the most striking examples of a complex miscarriage of justice where a central role was played by the press and public opinion the issue was blatant antisemitism as practiced by the army and defended by traditionalists especially catholics against secular and republican forces including most jews in the end the latter triumphed the affair began in november 1894 with the conviction for treason of captain alfred dreyfus a young french artillery officer of alsatian imprisonment for allegedly having communicated french military secrets to the german embassy in paris dreyfus was sent to the penal colony at devil s island in french guiana where he spent almost five years two years later in 1896 evidence came to light identifying a french army major named ferdinand walsin esterhazy as the real spy after high ranking military officials suppressed the new evidence a military court unanimously acquitted esterhazy after the second day of his trial the army accused dreyfus of additional charges based on false documents word of the military court s framing of dreyfus and of an attendant cover up began to spread chiefly owing to j accuse a vehement open letter published in a paris newspaper in january 1898 by the notable writer mile zola activists put pressure on the government to reopen the case in 1899 dreyfus was returned to france for another trial the intense political and judicial scandal that ensued divided french society between those who supported dreyfus now called dreyfusards such as anatole france condemned him the anti dreyfusards such as douard drumont the director and publisher of the antisemitic newspaper la libre parole the new trial resulted in another conviction and a 10 year sentence but dreyfus was given a pardon and set free eventually all the accusations against alfred dreyfus were demonstrated to be baseless in 1906 dreyfus was exonerated and reinstated as a major in the french army the affair from 1894 to 1906 divided france deeply and lastingly into two opposing camps the pro army mostly catholic anti dreyfusards who generally lost the initiative to the anticlerical pro republican dreyfusards it embittered french politics and allowed the radicals to come to power before world war ii by the early 1900s the conditions of the jews had improved tremendously and a wave of jewish immigration arrived in france mostly fleeing the pogroms of eastern europe immigration temporarily halted during world war i and jews fought in french forces but resumed afterwards jews were prominent in art and culture during this periodsuch as as modigliani soutine and chagall antisemitism declined during the 1920s in part because the fact that so many jews died fighting for france during world war i made it more difficult to accuse them of not being patriotic the antisemitic newspaper la libre parole closed in 1924 and the former anti dreyfusard maurice barrs included jews among france s spiritual families the influx of jewish refugees from germany and the jewishness of the popular front s leader lon blum contributed to a revival of antisemitism in the 1930s writers such as paul morand pierre gaxotte marcel jouhandeau and the leader of action franaise charles maurras denounced jews perhaps the most violent antisemitic writer was louis ferdinand cline who wrote i feel myself very friendly to hitler and to all germans whom i feel to be my brothers our real enemies are jews and masons and yids are like bedbugs by 1937 even mainstream conservatives and socialists not previously associated with antisemitism denounced the alleged jewish influence the popular front received the majority of votes in 1936 and france elected a jewish prime minister lon blum blum however was attacked by segments of the french far right for his jewishness while the action franaise far right leagues and the cagoule terrorist group engaged in antisemitic propaganda french jews and the holocaust when france came under occupation by nazi germany in june 1940 there were probably about 350 000 jews living in france less than half of them with french citizenship the others being foreigners mostly exiles from germany during the 1930s another 110 000 french jews were living in french algeria about 200 000 of them and the large majority of foreign jews resided in paris and its outskirts among the 150 000 french jews about 30 000 generally native from central europe had been naturalized french citizens during the 1930s besides alsace and a large part of lorraine which were annexed by germany france was divided into two zones the occupied and unoccupied some jews managed to escape the invading german forces especially from paris some found refuge in the country side spain also allowed 25 600 jews not necessarily only from france to use the country as an escape route the first anti jewish measure of the occupying power was published on 27 september 1940 with the publication of the first ordinance the measure was a census of jews and set out a definition of who is a jew the second ordinance was published on 18 october 1940 and proscribed various business activities for jews on 31 august 1941 all radios belonging to jews were confiscated and then their bicycles and then all phones to jews were disconnected and they were forbidden from using public telephones jews were forbidden to change their address and then to leave their homes between 8 pm and 5 am all public places parks theatres and certain shops were soon closed to jews new restrictions prohibitions and decrees proliferated by the week they were barred from public music halls etc on the metro they had to crowd into the last carriage antisemitic articles had been appearing constantly in newspapers since the occupation and antisemitic exhibitions were organised music of jewish writers were banned as were works of art on 2 october 1941 seven synagogues were bombed the first roundup of jews took place on 14 may 1941 involving 4 000 foreign jews another roundup took place on 20 august 1941 involving both french and foreign jews who were sent to the drancy internment camp and other concentration camps in france roundups continued involving lawyers french nationals and other professionals on 12 december 1941 the most distinguished members of the paris jewish community including doctors academics scientists and writers were rounded up on 29 may 1942 the eighth ordinance was published which ordered jews to wear the yellow star the most notorious roundup was the vel d hiv roundup which required detailed planning and the use of the full resources of and 17 july 1942 and involved nearly 13 000 jews 7 000 of which including over 4 000 children were packed and locked into the vlodrome d hiver in the meantime deportations from france to death camps commenced the first one taking place on 27 march 1942 deportations would continue until 17 august 1944 by which time nearly 76 000 jews including those from vichy france were deported of which only 2 500 survived see timeline of deportations of french jews to death camps the majority of jews deported were non french jews antisemitism was particularly virulent in vichy france the vichy government openly collaborated with the nazi occupiers to identify jews for deportation and transportation to the death camps as early as october 1940 without any request from the germans the vichy government passed anti jewish measures the statutes on jews prohibiting them from moving and limiting their access to public places and most professional activities in 1941 the vichy government established a commissariat gnral aux questions juives 1941 1944 gestapo to roundup jews including the vel d hiv roundup on 16 and 17 july 1942 on the other hand france has the third highest number of righteous among the nations according to the yad vashem museum 2006 this award is given to non jews who acted according to the most noble principles of humanity by risking their lives to save jews during the holocaust french president jacques chirac apologized in 1995 for the complicit role that french policemen and civil servants played in the roundups he said these black hours will stain our history for ever and are an injury to our past and our traditions yes the criminal madness of the occupant was assisted seconde by the french by the french state fifty three years ago on 16 july 1942 4500 policemen and gendarmes french under the authority of their leaders obeyed the demands of the nazis that day in the capital and the paris region nearly 10 000 jewish men women and children the morning and assembled at police stations france home of the enlightenment and the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen land of welcome and asylum france committed that day the irreparable breaking its word it delivered those it protected to their executioners post world war ii north african jewish migration in the wake of the holocaust 180 000 jews remained in france some of whom were refugees from eastern europe between 16 december 1946 and 22 january 1947 lon blum was head of state and head of government in 1951 the population was 250 000 in the 1940s and 1950s jewish refugees from europe resettled in france they were later joined by large numbers of jews from france s north african colonies who quickly assimilated in france their numbers increased after french decolonization of its territories abroad in 1962 and antisemitism in these newly formed nation states in total it is estimated that between 1956 and 1967 about 235 000 north african jews from algeria tunisia and morocco immigrated to france due six day war hence by 1968 jews of north african origin were a majority of the jews of france the north african jews enjoyed a successful social and economic integration in france while reinvigorating its jewish life kosher restaurants and jewish schools multiplied in particular since the 1980s and the religious renewal of the younger generation france was initially a very strong supporter of israel voting for its formation and becoming its main ally and primary supplier of military hardware between 1948 and 1967 after the suez crisis in 1956 relations between israel and france remained strong however after the algerian war in 1962 france progressively shifted towards a more pro arab view which accelerated rapidly after the six day war in 1967 the united states then became the main supplier of weapons and military technology of israel even if it has been neither confirmed nor denied by israel it is widely believed that according to the protocol of svres agreements france secretly transmitted parts of its own atomic technology to israel in the late 1950s france has the largest jewish population in europe and the third largest jewish population in the world after israel and the united states the jewish community in france is estimated from a core population of 480 000 500 000 to an enlarged population of 600 000 in 2009 france s highest court the council of state issued a ruling recognising the state s responsibility in the deportation of tens of thousands of jews during world war ii the report cited mistakes in the vichy regime that had not been forced by the occupiers stating that the state allowed or facilitated the deportation from france of victims of anti semitism antisemitism and immigration in the early 2000s rising levels of antisemitism among french muslims and antisemitic acts were publicized around the world including the desecration of jewish graves and tensions between the children of north african muslim immigrants and north african jewish children one of the worst crimes happened when ilan halimi was mutilated and tortured to death by the so called barbarians gang led by youssouf fofana this murder was motivated said they believed jews to be rich in march 2012 a gunman who had earlier killed 3 soldiers opened fire at a jewish school in toulouse in an anti semitic attack killing four people including three children president nicolas sarkozy said i want to say to all the leaders of the jewish community how close we feel to them all of france is by their side however jewish philanthropist baron eric de rothschild suggested that the extent of antisemitism in france has been exaggerated and that france was not an anti semitic country the newspaper le monde diplomatique had earlier said the same thing according to a 2005 poll made by the pew research center there is no evidence of any specific antisemitism in france which according to this poll appears to be one of the least antisemitic countries in europe though france has the world s third largest jewish population france is the country that has the most favourable views of jews in europe 82 with the least unfavourable views 16 next to the uk and the netherlands rises in antisemitism in modern france have been linked to the intensifying israelipalestinian conflict between the start of the israeli offensive in gaza in late december 2008 and its end in january 2009 an estimated hundred antisemitic acts were recorded in france this compares with a total of 250 antisemitic acts in the whole of 2007 in 2009 832 acts of antisemitism were recorded in france with in the first half of 2009 an estimated 631 acts more than the whole of 2008 474 in 2010 466 and in 2011 389 in 2011 there were 260 threats 100 graffitis 46 flyers or mails 114 insults and 129 crimes 57 assaults 7 arsons or attempted arsons 65 deteriorations and acts of vandalism but no murder attempted murder or terrorist attack recorded between 2000 and 2009 13 315 french jews moved to israel or made aliyah an increase that was in the continuity of a similar increase since the 1970s a peak was reached during this period in 2005 2005 2 951 olim but a significant proportion between 20 and 30 eventually came back to france some immigrants cited antisemitism and the growing arab population as reasons for leaving one couple who moved to israel claimed that rising antisemitism by french muslims and the anti israel bias of the french government was making life for jews increasingly uncomfortable for them at a welcoming ceremony for french jews in the summer of 2004 then israeli prime minister ariel sharon caused controversy when he advised all french jews to move immediately to israel and escape what he coined the wildest anti semitism in france in august 2007 some 2 800 olim were due to arrive in israel from france as opposed to the 3 000 initially forecast 1 129 french jews made aliyah to israel in 2009 and 1 286 in 2010 however in the long term and even if france has the world s third largest jewish community emigration toward israel in november 2012 israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu in a joint press conference with francois hollande advised the french jewish community by saying in my role as prime minister of israel i always say to jews wherever they may be i say to them come to israel and make israel your home alluding to former israel prime minister s ariel sharon s similar advisement towards the french jewish community to move to israel back in 2004 in 2013 3 120 french jews immigrated to israel marking a 63 increase over the previous year during the first few months of 2014 the jewish agency of israel has continued to encourage an increase of french aliyah through aliyah fairs hebrew language courses sessions which assist in potential olim to find jobs in israel and immigrant absorption in israel a may 2014 survey revealed that 74 percent of french jews consider leaving france for israel where of the 74 percent 29 9 percent cited anti semitism another 24 4 cited their desire to preserve by other countries economic considerations was cited by 7 5 percent of the respondents by june 2014 it was estimated by the end of 2014 a full 1 percent of the french jewish community will have made aliyah to israel the largest in a single year many jewish leaders stated the emigration is being driven by a combination of factors including the cultural gravitation towards israel and frances economic woes especially for the younger generation drawn by the possibility of other socioeconomic opportunities in the more vibrant israeli economy the different currents of judaism in france jews of france are divided in many groups reflecting the diversity of judaism today there are ultra orthodox haredim in a few yeshivot lubavitch focused on religious education modern orthodox in paris synagogue of montevideo street and agoudas hakehilos synagogue consistorian jews who are the majority following the grand rabbi of france currently a vacant position following the resignation of gilles bernheim masorti jews present in paris and following the rabbi rivon krygier and other smaller france is completely secular for instance the biggest religious organization the consistory has in paris only 30 000 members over a total of 300 000 jews in 2008 some black jews called for a black synagogue in france to fight against the feeling of exclusion they had in the french jewish community if the grand rabbi of france is the highest religious authority it is the conseil reprsentatif des institutions juives de france crif lead since 2013 by roger cukierman that has the political influence even if there is no discernable jewish vote in national elections and that this influence is far weaker than the one that has aipac in the us as can be seen during the dner annuel du crif that either the president in 2008 2011 2012 or the prime minister before 2008 in 2009 and 2010 attend alongside major political figures from both sides of the political spectrum like franois hollande dominique de villepin corinne lepage extreme or anti israel are not invited

for having tried to transcribe andalusian dialects to written form sir william scroggs c 1623 amp ndash 25 october 1683 lord chief justice of england was the son of an oxford landowner an account of him being the son of a butcher of sufficient means to give his son a university education is merely a rumour youth and early career scroggs spent his youth in stifford he went to oriel college and later to pembroke college oxford where he graduated in 1640 having acquired a fair knowledge of the classics there is some evidence that he fought on the royalist side during the civil war in 1653 he was called to the bar and soon gained a good practice in the courts he was appointed a judge of the common pleas in 1676 and two years later was promoted to be lord chief justice lord chief justice and the popish plot as lord chief justice scroggs presided at the trial of the persons denounced by titus oates for complicity in the popish plot and he treated with sarcasm and abuse while on their trial and taunting them when sentencing them to death so careless was he of the rights of the accused that at one trial he admitted to the jury that he had forgotten much of the evidence he may at first have been a sincere believer in the existence of the plot along with much of the general public and parliament but he did nothing to test the credibility of witnesses like oates william bedloe miles prance and thomas dangerfield even though he knew well that bedloe and dangerfield were leading figures in the criminal underworld and he probably also knew that prance had made his confession under threat of torture in november 1678 william staley a young catholic banker was executed for treason in that he had imagined i e threatened the king s death staley a heavy drinker had probably made a threat against the king when drunk but in less disturbed times he could have hoped to escape with a severe reprimand scroggs of a man s life he would have no regard paid to the rumours of the time but the rest of his summing up was wholly in favour of a guilty verdict a week later edward colman former private secretary to the duke of york was executed for allegedly treasonable correspondence with louis xiv of france again scroggs drove hard for a conviction despite colman s standing as a government official colman s letters in which he urged louis to press charles ii for a dissolution of parliament showed a grave lack of political judgement but it was straining the law to call them treasonable the correspondence which apparently ended in 1674 had no effect on english policy and was of such little importance that colman until he was confronted with the letters had apparently forgotten writing them scroggs told colman that he had been condemned on his own papers this was fortunate for the crown since the evidence of oates and bedloe of overt acts of treason was so feeble that scroggs in his summing up simply the prisoners henry berry robert green and lawrence hill accused of the murder of sir edmund berry godfrey scroggs gave a characteristic exhibition of his methods indulging in a tirade against the roman catholic religion and loudly proclaiming his belief in the guilt of the accused when lawrence hill s wife boldly accused miles prance the crown s chief witness of perjury in open court scroggs said incredulously you can not think that he will swear three men out of their lives for nothing all three defendants were put to death as mrs hill correctly predicted prance later confessed that the three were wholly innocent it was only when in july of the same year oates s accusation against the queen s physician sir george wakeman appeared likely to involve the queen herself in the ramifications of the plot that scroggs began to think matters were going too far he was probably also influenced by the discovery that the court regarded the plot with discredit and disfavour and that he had supposed with the king the chief justice on this occasion threw doubt on the trustworthiness of bedloe and oates as witnesses and warned the jury to be careful in accepting their evidence wakeman and a number of priests who were tried with him were duly acquitted this inflamed public opinion against scroggs for the popular belief in the plot was still strong scroggs continued in his poor treatment of catholic priests who came before him for trial as he showed when he sentenced andrew bromwich to death at stafford in the summer of 1679 nevertheless his proposing the duke of york s health at the lord mayor s dinner a few months later in the presence of shaftesbury indicated his determination not to support the exclusionists against the known wishes of the king at the opening of the michaelmas term he delivered a speech on the need for judicial independence the people ought to be pleased with public justice and not justice seek to please the people justice must flow like a mighty river neither corrupted an age that no man can with safety be just and follow his own conscience kenyon remarks that whatever scroggs s faults this speech shows that he was far more than the brainless bully he is sometimes portrayed as acting in the assurance of popular sympathy oates and bedloe now arraigned the chief justice before the privy council for having discredited their evidence and misdirected the jury in the wakeman case accusing him at the same time of several other misdemeanours on the bench including a habit of excessive drinking and foul language in january 1680 the case was argued before the council and scroggs was acquitted at the trials of elizabeth cellier and of lord castlemaine in june of the same year both of whom were acquitted he discredited dangerfield s evidence and on the former occasion committed the witness to prison in the same month he discharged the grand jury of middlesex before the end of term in order to save the duke of york from indictment as a popish recusant a proceeding which the was made an article in the impeachment of scroggs in january 1681 the dissolution of parliament put an end to the impeachment but in april scroggs was removed from the bench with a pension he died in london on 25 october 1683 personality and lifestyle scroggs was a judge at a time when the courts were considered corrupt and unfair and his temper and treatment of defendants were an example of the endemic problems within the judiciary he served on the bench during the same period as judge jeffreys who has also been criticised for similarly poor treatment of defendants and witnesses kenyon notes that while their behaviour was degrading and disgusting by modern standards it was at the time apparently taken for granted scroggs was the subject of many contemporary satires he was reputed to live a debauched lifestyle and his manners during trials were considered coarse and violent roger north who knew him well described him as a man of great wit and fluency but scandalous violent intemperate and extreme his celebrated attack on william whitshed lord chief justice of ireland called him as vile and profligate a villain as scroggs legal writings scroggs was the author of a work on the

phoenix press reissue the canadian red ensign is a former flag of canada used by the federal government though it was never adopted as official by the parliament of canada it is a british red ensign featuring the union flag in the canton defaced with the shield of the coat of arms of canada history the red ensign bearing some sort of a canadian emblem was used by canadians both on land and at sea beginning as early as 1868 soon after confederation on an informal or extra legal basis as prime minister sir john a macdonald constantly made use of it promoting it by precept and example throughout canada in 1892 it was authorized by admiralty warrant for use on ships registered in canada and this was enshrined in the canada shipping act of 1934 yet the flag had no legal status on land canada s official flag was the royal union flag until 1946 despite its lack of any official status on land the red ensign with canadian arms was widely until 1904 when it was replaced by the union flag various versions of the red ensign continued to be flown on land and the flag featured prominently in patriotic displays and recruiting efforts during first world war it can be seen in numerous photographs of canadian troops on the prime minister s car and in victory parades the original canadian red ensign had the arms of the four founding provinces on its shield however in the late 19th and early 20th century flag manufacturers would often supplement this design with laurel wreaths and crowns the design was frequently placed on a white square or circle in the flag s fly right hand side assuming the flagpole to be on the left there was no standard design for the red ensign until the early 1920s in 1921 the government of canada asked king george v to order a new coat of arms for canada the college of arms thus designed a suitable coat of arms of canada the new shield was displayed on the red ensign in 1922 in 1924 the red ensign was approved for use on canadian government buildings outside canada the canadian red ensign through history tradition and custom was finally formalized on 5 september 1945 when the governor general of canada signed an order in council p c 5888 which stated that the red ensign with the shield of the coat of arms in the fly to be referred to as the canadian red ensign may be flown from buildings owned or occupied by the canadian federal government within or without canada shall be appropriate to fly as a distinctive canadian flag so in 1945 the flag was approved for use by government buildings inside canada as well and once again flew over parliament the red ensign served until 1965 when it was replaced by today s maple leaf flag the flag bore various forms of the shield from the canadian coat of arms in its fly during the period of its use the picture top shows the official form between 1957 and 1965 from the same except that the leaves in the coat of arms were green and there was a slight alteration to the irish harp the earlier version having a woman s bust as part of the harp a blue ensign also bearing the shield of the canadian coat of arms was the jack flown by the royal canadian navy and the ensign of other ships owned by the canadian government until 1965 from 1865 until canadian confederation in 1867 the united province of canada could also have used a blue ensign but there is little evidence such a flag was ever used in o r jacobi s painting of the new parliament buildings in 1866 a red ensign flies from the tower of the east block vimy ridge red ensign the red ensign carried by the 5th canadian infantry battalion western cavalry at the battle of vimy ridge in 1917 survives to this day the battle was the first instance in which all four divisions of the canadian expeditionary force fought together as a such it is often viewed as a pivotal event in the emergence of canadian national identity the red ensign flown at vimy ridge in 1917 was the pre 1870 version with the arms of canada s first four provinces it is unclear why an outdated version of the flag was carried into the battle although it may have come from the flag locker of the merchant ship that brought the battalion to europe after the battle the flag was donated to the imperial war museum in the united kingdom by lieutenant colonel lorn paulet owen tudor of the 5th battalion an englishman who had emigrated to canada before the war the imperial war museum refused requests over the years to repatriate the vimy ridge red ensign to canada including a request in 2000 to acquire the flag for the ceremonies surrounding the dedication of canada s tomb of the unknown soldier david penn keeper of exhibits and firearms at the imperial war museum called the flag our most important first world war commonwealth artifact eventually after months of negotiations agreed to loan the flag to canada to commemorate the opening of the new canadian war museum in ottawa in 2005 the flag was returned to the united kingdom in 2008 being over 140 years old the vimy ridge red ensign is possibly the oldest canadian flag in existence there is another red ensign in existence that was reportedly carried by canadian troops at the battle of vimy ridge currently held by the penticton museum and archives in penticton british columbia it is a simple red ensign without a coat of arms variations before the design of the red ensign was standardized in 1921 flag makers made the badge larger each time a new province was added to the confederation this led to the creation of several unofficial but widely used flags at the opening ceremony of the 1936 olympic games a variant of the 19211957 red ensign with the arms inside a white disc was carried by canadian olympian and flag bearer james worrall however the normal version of the red ensign

pearson promised to introduce a new flag to replace the red ensign as a means of promoting national unity and a new canadian identity by replacing what was seen as a symbol of the british empire and colonialism with one that would be more inclusive of canadians who are not of british stock particularly french canadians in 1965 after the great flag debate in parliament and throughout the country as a whole the maple leaf flag was adopted groups such as the royal canadian legion and others who had sympathies with maintaining canada s links to britain opposed the new flag as they saw it as a means of loosening that connection the leader of the progressive conservative party john diefenbaker was especially passionate in his defence of the red ensign in protest of the federal government s decision progressive conservative governments in manitoba and ontario adopted the canadian red ensign continues to be flown by some canadians especially monarchism in canada a red ensign currently the 1868 version donated by the royal canadian legion will now be permanently flown alongside the maple leaf flag at the canadian national vimy memorial following its re dedication in april 2007 prime minister stephen harper made the decision after lobbying by veterans groups and then parliamentary secretary jason kenney supporters of the decision noted that the red ensign was the flag under which the canadian army had fought and that numerous other canadian war memorials and historical sites fly relevant historical flags critics including liberal senators marcel prud homme and romo dallaire attacked the move saying the old flag belongs in a museum not on a flagpole what s happening at vimy is a dangerous precedent because it could lead to the officialization of all sorts of flags prud homme said canadian blue ensign the canadian blue ensign is similar to the red ensign the flag was used as the jack of the royal canadian navy from its 1965 the blue ensign was approved by the british

as a jack for distinguishing purposes when at anchor or under way and dressed with masthead flags in 1937 the canadian government established that the canadian blue ensign the blue ensign of the dominion of canada would be used as a special ensign by the several canadian yacht clubs which had prior to then used the british blue ensign either plain or defaced as their special ensign this usage lasted until the 1965 introduction of the maple leaf flag today some canadian yacht clubs use the canadian blue ensign to commemorate this usage mis identification on 2 note during the early 1990s an

general john stricker s maryland militia and a british force led by major general robert ross although the americans retreated they were able to do so in good order having inflicted significant casualties on the british killing one of the commanders of the invading force significantly demoralizing the troops under his command and leaving some of his units lost among woods and swampy creeks with others in confusion this combination prompted brooke to delay his advance against baltimore buying valuable time to properly prepare for the defense of the city as stricker retreated back to the main defenses to bolster the existing force the engagement was a part of the larger battle of baltimore an american victory in the war of 1812 background british movements major general robert ross

battle of bladensburg on august 24 1814 and burned washington having disrupted the american government he withdrew to the waiting ships of the royal navy at the mouth of the patuxent river before heading further up the chesapeake bay to the strategically more important port city of baltimore although the americans managed to defeat a british landing at caulk s field before doing so ross s army of 3 700 troops and 1 000 marines landed at north point at the end of the peninsula between the patapsco river and the back river on the morning of september 12 1814 and began moving toward the city of baltimore american defenses major general samuel smith of the maryland militia anticipated the british move and dispatched brigadier general john stricker s column to meet them stricker s force consisted of five regiments of maryland militia a small militia cavalry regiment from maryland a battalion of three volunteer rifle companies and a battery of six 4 pounder field hill just outside baltimore where there were earthworks and artillery emplacements and north point at that point several tidal creeks narrowed the peninsula to only a mile wide and it was considered an ideal spot for opposing the british before they reached the main american defensive positions stricker received intelligence that the british were camped at a farm just 3 mi from his headquarters he deployed his men between bear creek and bread and cheese creek which offered cover from nearby woods and had a long wooden fence near the main road stricker placed the 5th maryland regiment and the 27th maryland regiment and his six guns in the front defensive line with two regiments the 51st and 39th in support and one more the 6th in reserve he placed his men in mutually supporting positions relying on numerous swamps and the two streams to stop a british flank attack all of which he hoped would help avoid another disaster such as bladensburg the riflemen initially occupied a position some the british advance however their commander captain william dyer hastily withdrew on hearing a rumour that british troops were landing from the back river behind him threatening to cut off his retreat stricker posted them instead on his right flank battle opening skirmish at about midday on the 12th stricker heard the british had halted while the soldiers had a meal and some sailors attached to ross s force plundered nearby farms he decided it would be better to provoke a fight rather than wait for a possible british night attack at 1 00 pm he sent major richard heath with 250 men and one cannon to draw the british to stricker s main force heath advanced down the road and soon began to engage the british pickets when ross heard the fighting he quickly left his meal and ran to the scene his men attempted to drive out the concealed american riflemen rear admiral george cockburn second in command of the royal navy american station who usually accompanied ross agreed that he would leave and bring back the main army however ross never got the chance as an american rifleman shot him in the chest mortally wounded ross turned command over to colonel arthur brooke and died soon after main battle brooke reorganized the british troops and prepared to assault the american positions at 3 00 pm he decided to use his three cannon to cover an attempt by the 4th regiment to get around the american flank while two more regiments and the naval brigade would assault the american center the british frontal assault took heavy casualties as the american riflemen fired into the british assault and lacking cannister the americans loaded their cannon with broken locks nails and horseshoes firing scrap metal at the british advance nevertheles the british 4th regiment managed to outflank the american positions and sent many of the american regiments fleeing stricker was able to conduct an organized retreat with his men firing volleys as they continued to fall back this proved effective killing among woods and swampy creeks with others in confusion not all the militia regiments performed with equal distinction the 51st regiment and some men of the 39th broke and ran under fire however the 5th maryland regiment corporal john mchenry of the 5th regiment wrote of the battle our regiment the 5th carried off the praise from the other regiments engaged so did the company to which i have the honor to belong cover itself with glory when compared to the other regiments we were the last that left the ground had our regiment not retreated at the time it did we should have been cut off in two minutes brooke did not follow the retreating americans he had advanced to within a mile of the main american position but he had suffered heavier casualties than the americans as it was getting dark he chose to wait until fort mchenry was expected to be neutralized while stricker withdrew to baltimore s main defences casualties the official british army casualty killed and 251 wounded of these 28 killed and 217 wounded belonged to the british army 6 killed and 20 wounded belonged to the 2nd and 3rd battalions of the royal marines 4 killed and 11 wounded belonged to the contingents of royal marines detached from cockburn s fleet and 1 killed elias taylor and 3 wounded belonged to the royal marine artillery as was normal the royal navy submitted a separate casualty return for the engagement signed by rear admiral cockburn which gives 4 sailors killed and 28 wounded but contradicts the british army casualty report by giving 3 killed 1 and 2 from hms madagascar and hms ramillies respectively and 15 wounded for the royal marines detached from the ships of the naval fleet a subsequent casualty return from cochrane to the admiralty dated 22 september 1814 gives 6 sailors killed 1 missing and 32 wounded with royal marines casualties of 1 killed and 16 wounded the total british losses as officially 42 killed and 283 wounded depending on which of the two casualty returns was accurate historian franklin r mullaly gives still another version of the british casualties 46 killed and 295 wounded despite using these same sources the american loss was 24 killed 139 wounded and 50 taken prisoner aftermath the battle had been costly for the british apart from the other casualties losing general ross was a critical blow to the british he was a respected leader of british forces in the peninsular war and the war of 1812 ross s death proved a blow to british morale as well the combined effect of the blow suffered at north point and the failure of the royal navy to capture or get past fort mchenry at the entrance to baltimore harbor despite a 25 hour bombardment proved to be the turning point of the battle of baltimore during the bombardment on fort mchenry francis scott key was detained on a british ship at the entrance to baltimore and penned the words to the star spangled cautiously towards baltimore there was no more opposition from stricker but when the british came into view of the main defenses of baltimore brooke estimated them to be manned by up to 22 000 militia with 100 cannon he prepared to make a night assault against the defenses at loudenslager hill but asked vice admiral alexander cochrane to send boats and bomb vessel legacy the battle is commemorated through the maryland state holiday of defenders day the

whitehorne joseph a 1997 the battle for baltimore 1814 baltimore nautical amp aviation publishing isbn mostek was an integrated circuit manufacturer founded in 1969 by ex employees of texas instruments initially their products were manufactured in worcester massachusetts however by 1974 most of its manufacturing was done in the carrollton texas facility on crosby road at its peak in the late 1970s mostek held an 85 market share of the dynamic random access memory dram memory chip market worldwide until being eclipsed by japanese dram manufacturers who offered equivalent chips at lower prices by dumping memory on the market in 1979 soon after its market peak mostek was purchased by united technologies corporation for 345m in 1985 after several years of red ink and declining market share utc sold mostek for 71m to the french electronics firm thomson sa later part of stmicroelectronics mostek s intellectual property portfolio which included rights to the intel x86 microprocessor family as well as many foundational patents in dram technology provided a large windfall of royalty payments for stmicroelectronics in the 1990s early calculator business mostek s circuit design the first design to be produced in their newly set up mos fab in worcester was the mk1001 a simple shifter chip this was followed by a 1k pmos aluminum gate dram the mk4006 that was manufactured in their carrollton facility mostek had been working with sprague electric to develop the ion implantation process which provided a tremendous gain in the control of doping profiles using ion implantation mostek became an early leader in mos manufacturing technology while their competition was still mostly using the older bipolar technology the resulting increased speed and lower cost of the mk4006 memory chip made it the runaway favorite to ibm and other mainframe and minicomputer manufacturers cf bunch digital equipment corporation in 1970 busicom a japanese adding machine manufacturer approached intel and mostek with a proposal to introduce a new electronic calculator line intel responded first providing them with the intel 4004 which they used in a line of desktop calculators mostek s device took longer to develop but was a single chip solution new handheld line the busicom le 120a which went on the market in 1971 and was the smallest calculator available for some time hewlett packard also contracted with mostek for mask development and production of chips for their hp 35 and hp 45 lines world leader in dram mostek co founder robert proebsting invented dram address multiplexing with the mk4096 4096 x 1 bit dram introduced in 1973 address multiplexing was a revolutionary approach which reduced cost and board space by fitting a 4k dram into a 16 pin package while competitors took the evolutionary approach which led to a bulky and relatively expensive 22 pin package competitors derided the mostek approach as unnecessarily complex but proebsting understood the future roadmap for dram memories would benefit greatly if only one new pin were needed for every 4x increase in memory size instead of the two pins per 4x for the evolutionary approach computer manufacturers found address multiplexing to be a compelling feature as they saw a future 64kb dram chip would save 8 pins if implemented with address multiplexing and subsequent generations even more integrated circuits plus the multiplexed approach used less silicon area which further reduces chip cost the mk4096 was produced using an nmos aluminum gate process with an added interconnect layer of polysilicon dubbed the spin process the fear uncertainty and doubt put up by the competition regarding address multiplexing was dispelled by the actual performance of the mk4096 which proved solid and robust in all types of computer memory designs in 1976 mostek introduced the silicon gate mk4027 an improved version of the metal gated mk4096 and the new mk4116 16kb double poly silicon gate dram they were designed by paul schroeder who later left mostek to co found inmos from this point until the late 1970s mostek was a continual leader in the dram field holding as much as 85 of the world market for dram the mk4027 and mk4116 were reverse engineered by mosaid and successfully cloned by many companies the 64k generation of drams required a transition from 12 volt to 5 volt operation while most competitors took a conservative approach by scaling the basic mk4116 design and features such as controlled precharge current that were not necessary at the 64k node and delayed their entry into the market mostek s 256k dram was further delayed by a then ambitious two layer metallization design when the price for 64k drams collapsed mostek s 256k device was not ready for volume production and the company suffered heavy losses world leader in telecommunications products mostek enjoyed many years of mastery of the international market for telecommunications products their product line included telephone tone and pulse dialers touchtone decoders counters top octave generators used by hammond baldwin and others codecs watch circuits and a host of custom products for a variety of customers the custom products used the simple pmos process and helped maintain mostek s cash flow through a smoky fire in the fab that closed it for six months intense dram competition and other semiconductor market pressures during the fab shutdown production of the pmos products was shifted to several external fabs several employees played a key role in the department assisted by charles johnson william h bradley robert c jones robert banks ted lewis darin kincaid william cummings and a host of other key employees paluck left mostek to work with sevin rosen partners and convex computer bradley designed all of the custom products based on the single chip calculator platform as well as the code for the wristwatch devices produced by mostek for bulova and other customers for a short while paluck headed a joint venture called mostek hong kong a collaboration with bulova for the production of high end wristwatches based on mostek designs mr bradley was an employee of that joint venture as mostek s focus was shifted to its dram products the industrial and telecommunications products were ignored and their market share vanished microprocessor second sourcing deals with this foundation in calculator chips and high volume dram production mostek gained a reputation as a leading semiconductor fabrication house fab in the early 1970s one of their more popular products was the mostek 3870 which into a single chip which they introduced in 1977 william h bradley designed a host of custom products based on the mk3870 fairchild later licensed the 3870 back from mostek they also produced rom chips on demand as well as the chips powering the hammond electronic organ mostek cut a deal with a startup zilog in which mostek provided fab resources to manufacture the zilog microprocessors in return for second sourcing rights to the zilog family mostek produced mk3880 the zilog z80 and a series of z80 support chips until zilog built their own fab the z80 eventually became the most popular microcomputer family as it was used in millions of embedded devices as well as in many home computers and computers using the de facto standard cp m operating system such as the osborne kaypro and trs 80 models when vin prothro president and l j sevin chairman of the board discovered that zilog had modified the recipe for z80 chips to keep the yields low thereby buying zilog time to partner they negotiated a deal with intel to gain second sourcing rights to the intel 8086 microprocessor family and the future x86 designs after sevin left to become a venture capitalist founding compaq and many other companies prothro signed another pivotal deal with motorola to gain the rights to the motorola 68000 and vme computers the intel x86 microprocessors would go on to become the brains for the ibm pc while the motorola 68000 would become the heart of the apple computer line mostek had secured the rights to every microprocessor family that would be important for the next 25 years however mostek chose not to aggressively follow up its entry into microprocessorsinstead maintaining its concentration on the highly competitive and thereby unprofitable dram business the decline in the face of asian competition mostek merged with united technologies in 1979 to prevent an unfriendly takeover from gould at the 10th anniversary of the company s founding when a large block of stock options controlled by sprague stock became vested united technologies blew their investment knowing how to build jet engines is n t the same and had no comprehension of either the up front investment required or the long time for roi they also sacrificed their leadership position in some markets and put all of their eggs in the dram basket they eventually spent hundreds of millions trying to keep the company going during the various semiconductor and videogame crashes of the early 1980s and eventually gave up and sold it to thomson semiconductor in 1985 for a mere 71 million unfortunately the dram marketplace was the beachhead where japanese firms would make their successful assault on the global semiconductor market mostek was unable to match the japanese extremely aggressive pricing and succumbed during a particularly brutal price war when korean firms including samsung now the worlds largest electronics conglomerate tried to beat the japanese at their own game micron technology one of several mostek spinoffs would later bring suit to prove the japanese memory manufacturers guilty of price dumping but the ruling would be too late to save mostek in an attempt to return the company to profitability the next year they merged with sgs ates to become stmicroelectronics based in geneva switzerland although by this time most of mostek s designs were no longer commercially viable their dram patents turned out to be valuable and stm started a series of lawsuits to collect royalties between 1987 and 1993 stm made 450 million on these licenses alone mostek spinoffs jerry rogers founded cyrix in 1988 to capitalize on the mostek second source agreement that allowed any 80x86 processor to be legally copied which intel attempted to stop via lawsuits eventually after losing many legal battles intel simply changed the name of the 80586 to the pentium thereby ending the agreement micron technology was a very successful spinoff founded by a handful of mostek employees including ward parkinson dennis wilson and doug pitman citation needed mabel is an english female given name derived from the latin amabilis lovable dear amabilis of riom d 475 was a french male saint who logically would have assumed the name amabilis upon entering the priesthood his veneration may have resulted in amabilis being used as both a male and female name or the name s female usage may have been initiated by the female saint amabilis of rouen d 634 the daughter of an anglo saxon king who would have adopted the name amabilis upon becoming a nun the vernacular french form amable was brought by the normans to the british isles where both amabel and the abbreviated mabel were common during the middle ages to subsequently become obsolete apart from mabel remaining in regular use in ireland where it was perceived as a variant of the celtic name maeve mabel s modern usage was subsequent to the 1853 publication of the novel the heir of redclyffe by charlotte m yonge which featured a character who was irish named named amabel but her novel only boosted the popularity of the name in the form mabel which became immensely popular in both the british isles and the united states at the start of the 20th century mabel s popularity began a slow decline which accelerated from the 1930s with the name in very light usage since the 1960s due to its origin as an abridgement of amabel it has been surmised that mabel was originally pronounced with a short a the name s pronunciation with a long a dating only from its mid

the prefix for operational shuttles is ov for orbiter vehicle the suffix is composed of two parts the series and the vehicle number series 0 non flight ready shuttles 1 flight ready shuttles the vehicle number is sequentially assigned within the series beginning with 1 therefore there can never be an ov 100 as it would read orbiter vehicle series 1 vehicle 0 many proposals to build a second generation of orbiters externally compatible with the current system but internally new refer to them as ov 200 or ov 2xx in order to differentiate them from the current generation the ov 100s this terminology is informal and it is unlikely that any shuttle derived vehicle built will be given such designation orbiter designations ov 099 space shuttle challenger originally sta 099 ov 101 space shuttle enterprise ov 102 space shuttle columbia ov 104 space shuttle atlantis ov 105 space shuttle endeavour challenger was originally intended to be used as a structural test article rather than a flight capable orbiter as such the numbering was changed when she was rebuilt enterprise on the other hand was intended to be rebuilt into a flight capable orbiter it was found to be cheaper to rebuild sta 099 than ov 101 so she remained unflown the designations were not altered despite these changes in plans other official designations in keeping with this theme other pieces of ground hardware used by the space shuttle program have been given official designations these include ov 095 a mockup in the shuttle avionics integration laboratory sail at johnson space center sta 096 environmental control and life support system structural test article sta 097 vibro acoustic mid fuselage structural test article mpta 098 the main propulsion test article see below of structural components manufactured to replace those used in the construction of endeavour however the contract for these was cancelled shortly afterwards and they were never completed the 096 and 097 designators were given to structural test articles that were cancelled but while they exist in some nasa records the nasa history office has no official record of sta 096 and sta 097 unofficial and honorary designations one structural mockup has been given an retroactively unofficial and honorary ov xxx designation ov 098 space shuttle pathfinder a mockup in huntsville al note that while pathfinder is referred to as ov 098 she should not be confused with mpta 098 the main propulsion test article a steel frame looking nothing like an orbiter used to test the space shuttle main engines pathfinder was originally a fit check unit a simple mockup resembling the production orbiters in size shape and weight intended to be used to ensure that ground handling facilities rebuilt to resemble them cosmetically and is currently on display with the external tank used during the propulsion tests designated mpta et to further add to the confusion it appears that pathfinder was never formally numbered and the ov 098 designation is both unofficial and retroactive mpta 098 was later rebuilt into the shuttle c mockup during the 1990s it is currently in storage at the stennis space center other unofficial designations finally one structural mockup was given an unofficial ov xxx designation in a 2006 version of this article while not official the designation appears to be somewhat accepted ov 100 space shuttle independence formerly explorer a mockup in houston tx references recombinant dna rdna molecules are dna molecules formed by laboratory methods of genetic recombination such as molecular cloning to bring together genetic material from multiple sources creating sequences that would not otherwise be found in biological organisms recombinant dna is possible because dna molecules from all organisms share the same chemical structure they differ only in the nucleotide sequence within that identical overall structure introduction recombinant dna molecules are sometimes called chimeric dna because they are usually made of material from two different species like the mythical chimera r dna technology uses palindromic sequences and leads to the production of sticky and blunt ends the dna sequences used in the construction of recombinant dna molecules can originate from any species for example plant dna may be joined to bacterial dna or human dna may be joined with fungal dna in addition dna sequences that do not occur anywhere in nature may be created by the chemical synthesis of dna and incorporated into recombinant molecules using recombinant dna technology created and introduced into any of a very wide range of living organisms proteins that can result from the expression of recombinant dna within living cells are termed recombinant proteins when recombinant dna encoding a protein is introduced into a host organism the recombinant protein is not necessarily produced expression of foreign proteins requires the use of specialized expression vectors and often necessitates significant restructure by foreign coding sequence recombinant dna differs from genetic recombination in that the former results from artificial methods in the test tube while the latter is a normal biological process that results in the remixing of existing dna sequences in essentially all organisms creating recombinant dna molecular cloning is the laboratory process used to create recombinant dna it is one of two widely used methods along with polymerase chain reaction abbr pcr used to direct the replication of any specific dna sequence chosen by the experimentalist the fundamental difference between the two methods is that molecular cloning involves replication of the dna within a living cell while pcr replicates dna formation of recombinant dna requires a cloning vector a dna molecule that replicates within a living cell vectors are generally derived from plasmids or viruses and represent relatively small segments of dna that contain necessary genetic signals for replication as well as additional elements for convenience in inserting foreign dna identifying cells that contain recombinant dna and where appropriate expressing the foreign dna the choice of vector for molecular cloning depends on the choice of host organism the size of the dna to be cloned and whether and how the foreign dna is to be expressed the dna segments can be combined by using a variety of methods such as restriction enzyme ligase cloning or gibson assembly in standard cloning protocols the cloning of any dna fragment essentially involves seven steps 1 choice of host organism and cloning vector 2 preparation of vector dna 3 preparation of dna to be cloned 4 creation of recombinant dna 5 introduction of recombinant dna into containing recombinant dna and 7 screening for clones with desired dna inserts and biological properties these steps are described in some detail in a related article molecular cloning expression of recombinant dna following transplantation into the host organism the foreign dna contained within the recombinant dna construct may or may not be expressed that is the dna may simply be replicated without expression or it may be transcribed and translated so that a recombinant protein is produced generally speaking expression of a foreign gene requires restructuring the gene to include sequences that are required for producing an mrna molecule that can be used by the host s translational apparatus e g promoter translational initiation signal and transcriptional terminator specific changes to the host organism may be made to improve expression of the ectopic gene in addition changes may be needed to the coding sequences as well to optimize translation make the protein soluble direct the recombinant protein to the proper cellular or extracellular properties of organisms containing recombinant dna in most cases organisms containing recombinant dna have apparently normal phenotypes that is their appearance behavior and metabolism are usually unchanged and the only way to demonstrate the presence of recombinant sequences is to examine the dna itself typically using a polymerase chain reaction pcr test significant exceptions exist and are discussed below if the rdna sequences encode a gene that is expressed then the presence of rna and or protein products of the recombinant gene can be detected typically using rt pcr or western hybridization methods gross phenotypic changes are not the norm unless the recombinant gene has been chosen and modified so as to generate biological activity in the host organism additional phenotypes that are encountered include toxicity to the host organism induced by the recombinant gene product especially if it is over expressed or expressed within inappropriate cells or tissues in some cases recombinant dna can have deleterious effects even if it is not expressed one mechanism by which this happens is insertional inactivation cell s gene in some cases researchers use this phenomenon to knock out genes to determine their biological function and importance another mechanism by which rdna insertion into chromosomal dna can affect gene expression is by inappropriate activation of previously unexpressed host cell genes this can happen for example when a recombinant dna fragment containing an active promoter becomes located next to a previously silent host cell gene or when a host cell gene that functions to restrain gene expression undergoes insertional inactivation by recombinant dna applications of recombinant dna technology recombinant dna is widely used in biotechnology medicine and research today recombinant proteins and other products that result from the use of rdna technology are found in essentially every western pharmacy doctor s or veterinarian s office medical testing laboratory and biological research laboratory in addition organisms that have been manipulated using recombinant dna technology as well as products derived from those organisms have found their way into many farms supermarkets home medicine cabinets and even pet genetically modified animals the most common application of recombinant dna is in basic research in which the technology is important to most current work in the biological and biomedical sciences recombinant dna is used to identify map and sequence genes and to determine their function rdna probes are employed in analyzing gene expression within individual cells and throughout the tissues of whole organisms recombinant proteins are widely used as reagents in laboratory experiments and to generate antibody probes for examining protein synthesis within cells and organisms many additional practical applications of recombinant dna are found in industry food production human and veterinary medicine agriculture and bioengineering some specific examples are identified below recombinant chymosin found in rennet is an enzyme required to manufacture cheese it was the first genetically engineered food additive used commercially traditionally processors obtained chymosin from rennet a preparation derived from the fourth stomach of milk fed calves scientists engineered a non pathogenic strain k 12 of e coli bacteria for large scale laboratory identical structurally to the calf derived enzyme costs less and is produced in abundant quantities today about 60 of u s hard cheese is made with genetically engineered chymosin in 1990 fda granted chymosin 28 276217 toolong gras status based on data showing that the enzyme was safe recombinant human insulin almost completely replaced insulin obtained from animal sources e g pigs and cattle for the treatment of insulin dependent diabetes a variety of different recombinant insulin preparations are in widespread use recombinant insulin is synthesized by inserting the human insulin gene into e coli which then produces insulin for human use recombinant human growth hormone hgh somatotropin administered to patients whose pituitary glands generate insufficient quantities to support normal growth and development before recombinant hgh became available hgh for therapeutic use was obtained from pituitary glands of cadavers this unsafe practice led to some patients developing creutzfeldt jacob disease recombinant hgh eliminated this problem and is now used therapeutically it has also been misused as recombinant blood clotting factor viii a blood clotting protein that is administered to patients with forms of the bleeding disorder hemophilia who are unable to produce factor viii in quantities sufficient to support normal blood coagulation before the development of recombinant factor viii the protein was obtained by processing large quantities of human blood from multiple donors which carried a very high risk of transmission of blood borne infectious diseases for example hiv and hepatitis b recombinant hepatitis b vaccine hepatitis b infection is controlled through the use of a recombinant hepatitis b vaccine which contains a form of the hepatitis b virus surface antigen that is produced in yeast cells the development of the recombinant subunit vaccine was an important and necessary development because hepatitis b virus unlike other common viruses such as polio virus can not be grown in vitro diagnosis of infection with hiv each of the three widely used methods for diagnosing hiv infection has been developed using recombinant dna the antibody test elisa or western blot uses a recombinant the body has produced in response to an hiv infection the dna test looks for the presence of hiv genetic material using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt pcr development of the rt pcr test was made possible by the molecular cloning and sequence analysis of hiv genomes golden rice a recombinant variety of rice that has been engineered to express the enzymes responsible for carotene biosynthesis this variety of rice holds substantial promise for reducing the incidence of vitamin a deficiency in the world s population golden rice is not currently in use pending the resolution of regulatory issues herbicide resistant crops commercial varieties of important agricultural crops including soy maize corn sorghum canola alfalfa and cotton have been developed that incorporate a recombinant gene that results in resistance to the herbicide glyphosate trade name roundup and simplifies weed control by glyphosate application these crops are in common commercial use in several countries insect resistant crops bacillus thuringeiensis is a bacterium insecticidal properties the bacterium has been applied to crops as an insect control strategy for many years and this practice has been widely adopted in agriculture and gardening recently plants have been developed that express a recombinant form of the bacterial protein which may effectively control some insect predators environmental issues associated with the use of these transgenic crops have not been fully resolved history of recombinant dna the idea of recombinant dna was first proposed by peter lobban a graduate student of prof dale kaiser in the biochemistry department at stanford university medical school the first publications describing the successful production and intracellular replication of recombinant dna appeared in 1972 and 1973 stanford university applied for a us patent on recombinant dna in 1974 listing the inventors as stanley n cohen and herbert w boyer this patent was awarded in 1980 the first licensed drug generated using recombinant dna technology was human insulin developed by genentech and licensed by eli lilly and company controversy scientists associated with the initial development of recombinant recombinant dna to have undesirable or dangerous properties at the 1975 asilomar conference on recombinant dna these concerns were discussed and a voluntary moratorium on recombinant dna research was initiated for experiments that were considered particularly risky this moratorium was widely observed until the national institutes of health usa developed and issued formal guidelines for rdna work today recombinant dna molecules and recombinant proteins are usually not regarded as dangerous however concerns remain about some organisms that express recombinant dna particularly when they leave the laboratory and are introduced into the environment or food chain these concerns are discussed in the articles on genetically modified organisms and genetically modified food controversies throwdown is an american straight edge metallic hardcore band from orange county california formed in 1997 they have toured as part of ozzfest sounds of the underground hellfest and warped tour and with bands such as in flames lamb of god as i lay dying killswitch engage korn and cavalera conspiracy the songs forever and burn have been staples on mtv2 s headbanger s ball and revolver magazine called them part of the future of metal after hearing the album vendetta initially branded a hardcore band their most recent albums venom and tears and deathless have taken a sharp direction towards metal with critics likening the band s sound to that of pantera sepultura and crowbar history early years 19972002 throwdown was formed in 1997 by vocalist aka lead singer keith barney who would also be an active member of both adamantium and eighteen visions guitarists tommy love and javier van the group took on the title throwdown as a wry irony on their collective stature at the time no band member being more than 5ft8 in the band released their debut self titled 7 inch single that same year through prime directive records van huss left the band and was replaced by brandan schieppati after sign a recording contract with indecision records the band released their first studio album beyond repair the following year in 1999 barney also relinquished his role in death by stereo to prioritise throwdown schieppati left the band to concentrate full time on his other band bleeding through being replaced by dave peters the following year the new line up released the drive me dead ep in 2001 throwdown released their second

tombs 2010 directed by cale glendening the blinding light 2010 directed by cale glendening date october 30 1838 the haun s mill massacre was an event in the history of the latter day saint movement it occurred on october 30 1838 when a mob militia unit from livingston county missouri attacked a mormon settlement in eastern caldwell county missouri united states after the battle of crooked river by far the bloodiest event in the 1838 mormon war in missouri it has long been remembered by the members of the latter day saint movement the fifty five attackers known by name to be involved were never prosecuted haun s mill haun s mill was a mill established on the banks of shoal creek in fairview township caldwell county missouri in 18351836 by jacob haun hawn who was not a mormon however by october 1838 there were approximately 75 mormon families living along the banks of shoal creek about 30 of them in the immediate vicinity of haun s mill and the blacksmith shop missouri militia the militia involved in of livingston county at the time of the attack it consisted of 240 men from daviess livingston ray carroll and chariton counties and included prominent men such as charles ashby of the missouri state legislature and thomas o byron clerk of livingston county although the massacre took place a few days after missouri s governor lilburn boggs issued his infamous extermination order most historians have now concluded that the militia unit had neither the time nor the opportunity to have received news of the order truce the threat posed by the growing strength and animosity of the missouri militia caused considerable concern among the mormon settlers at haun s mill they held a council on sunday october 28 and decided to organize a defensive force 28 men were armed and held in readiness against an attack that same evening one of the militia groups sent a representative who negotiated a truce with the settlers monday the 29th and most of tuesday the 30th passed without incident massacre on into the community david evans a leader in the community ran towards the militia waving his hat and calling for peace alerted to the militia s approach most of the latter day saint women and children fled into the woods to the south while most of the men headed to the blacksmith shop unfortunately the building was a particularly vulnerable structure as the widely spaced logs made it easy for the attackers to fire inside the shop became a deathtrap since the militia gave no quarter firing about one hundred rifle and musket shots into the building after the initial attack several of those who had been wounded or had surrendered were shot dead members of the militia entered the shop and found ten year old sardius smith eight year old alma smith and nine year old charles merrick hiding under the blacksmith s bellows alma and charles were shot charles later died and william reynolds put his musket against sardius s skull and blew off the top of his head killing him reynolds he had lived he would have become a mormon seventy eight year old thomas mcbride surrendered his musket to militiaman jacob rogers who then shot mcbride and hacked his body apart with a corn knife several other bodies were mutilated or clothing stolen while many women were assaulted houses were robbed wagons tents and clothing were stolen and horses and livestock were driven off leaving the surviving women and children destitute by the end of the massacre at least seventeen mormons were dead hiram abbott elias benner john byers alexander campbell simon cox josiah fuller austin hammer john lee benjamin lewis thomas mcbride 78 charley merrick 9 levi merrick william napier george s richards sardius smith 10 warren smith 44 and john york thirteen more had been injured including a woman and nine year old child a non mormon sympathizer was also killed three of the 250 militiamen were wounded but none fatally after the massacre covered with dirt and straw the survivors and their wounded gathered at far west for protection aftermath after the massacre philo dibble stated that brother joseph had sent word by haun who owned the mill to inform the brethren who were living there to leave and come to far west but mr haun did not deliver the message of the matter joseph smith recorded up to this day god had given me wisdom to save the people who took counsel none had ever been killed who abode by my counsel then he recorded that innocent lives could have been saved at hauns mill had his counsel been received and followed it appears that haun had received the direction to relocate to far west from joseph smith and did not convey this direction to any of the others at haun s mill although participants in the massacre boasted of their acts for years none of the missouri attackers were ever brought to trial and the latter day saints efforts at receiving justice in the massacre are maintained as a historic site by the community of christ in may 2012 it was announced that the the church of jesus christ of latter day saints had acquired the property from the community of christ the church had also acquired the far west burying ground from the community of christ this event was dramatized in the latter day saint film legacy apollodotus ii greek was an indo greek king who ruled in the western and eastern parts of punjab bopearachchi dates him to circa 8065 bce and r c senior to circa 8565 bce apollodotos ii was an important ruler who seems to have re established the indo greek kingdom to some extent of its former glory taxila in western punjab was reconquered from nomad scythian rule and according to bopearachchi eastern territory was taken back from indian kingdoms rule apollodotus ii seems to have been a member of the dynasty of menander i since he used their typical deity athena alkidemos on most of his silver and also menander s title soter greek the saviour on all his coins on some coins he also calls himself philopator greek the father loving which proves that his father had been king before him r c senior guesses that amyntas or epander could have been his father apollodotus scythian king maues ruled in gandhara and its capital taxila what probably happened is that apollodotus ii took over taxila after the death of maues though it is uncertain whether he defeated maues or his descendants or was allied or related to the dynasty of maues the late indo greeks may have been rather mixed with both indians and scythians r c senior suggests that apollodotus had struck an alliance with another scythian king azes i the scythian hold of gandhara loosened after the death of maues and petty kings of mixed or uncertain origin like artemidorus the son of maues telephus and perhaps menander ii emerged in the area these kings posed no threat to apollodotus ii who on some of his coins assumed the title basileus megas greek great king in echo of maues boastful title great king of kings after the death of apollodotus ii the indo greek kingdom fragmented once more coins of apollodotus ii obv greek legend reads of in kharoshthi script tratarasa maharajasa apalatasa saviour king appolodotus with goddess athena type of menander i apollodotus ii issued a large number of coins he struck silver a with diademed portrait on the obverse and a reverse of athena alkidemos and also a unique coin with the reverse of a king possibly alexander the great sitting on a horned horse similar to alexander s bucephalus and holding his hand in a benediction gesture he struck bronzes with apollo tripod a type introduced by his namesake apollodotus i the coins of apollodotus ii are of different qualities some still have the realistic portraits characteristic of the earlier indo greek coins and bopearachchi attributes these series to the western part of his kingdom others are badly struck and or have clumsy and distorted portraits and these bopearachchi interprets as belonging to newly opened mints in eastern punjab presumably struck by indian celators with little knowledge of greek engraving skills on some of his coins there are both extra monograms in shape of kharosthi letters these monograms are interpreted belonged to officials with indian names the coins therefore indicate that apollodotus ii relied more on his indian subjects than earlier kings and also opened new mints in eastern punjab where greek presence was scarce overstrikes apollodotus ii overstruck a bronze of maues zoilos ii overstruck some of the coins of apollodotus ii as did azes i 14 7143 br align center

of impassioned but inconclusive letters written in 1875 amp ndash 1876 by james to the russian aristocrat paul zhukovski while edel was deep in the process of finishing his biography caused an ethical crisis his decision was of the self identified celibate and sexually diffident james s life edel did treat james s relationships with novelist constance fenimore woolson and sculptor hendrik christian andersen at length especially in volumes three and four of the biography after weighing all the evidence edel confessed that he was unable to decide whether james experienced a consummated sexual relationship although later scholarship and new materials have called into question the accuracy of his portrait of james edel s work remains an important source for studies of the author a biography seems irrelevant if it does n t discover the overlap between what the individual did and the life that made this possible without discovering that you have shapeless happenings and gossip leon edel

known as the deluge according to hajo holborn it marked the beginning of prussian military history in the battle a smaller swedish brandenburg force gained victory over a polish lithuanian force superior in numbers though in the long term the victory achieved little polish lithuanian losses were insignificant since the polish noble levy promptly retreated from the battlefield prelude the polish lithuanian forces commanded by king john ii casimir of poland comprised about 24 25 000 regulars which included only 950 winged hussars 8 banners 2 000 tatars and 10 13 000 of the noble levy

born february 20 1957 in san giuseppe jato is a former member of the sicilian mafia he murdered the anti mafia prosecutor giovanni falcone in 1992 and once stated that he had committed between 100 and 200 murders but was unable to remember the exact number he was sentenced to life in prison in absentia captured in 1996 and started to cooperate with the authorities a pudgy bearded and unkempt mafioso brusca was known in mafia circles as u verru in sicilian or il porco or il maiale in italian the pig the swine or lo scannacristiani people slayer in italian dialects the word christians often stands for human beings tommaso buscetta the mafia turncoat who had cooperated with falcones investigations remembered giovanni brusca as a wild stallion but a great leader mafia career born in san giuseppe jato giovanni brusca seems to have been and great grandfather both farmers were made members of the mafia his father bernardo brusca a local mafia patriarch served concurrent life sentences for numerous homicides bernardo brusca allied himself with the corleonesi of salvatore riina and bernardo provenzano when he replaced antonio salamone as capo mandamento of san giuseppe jato paving the way for his three sons careers apart from giovanni his younger brother vincenzo and elder brother emanuele in cosa nostra s most powerful and ruthless clan by the age of 20 brusca was reportedly working as a driver for bernardo provenzano all the pentiti have described him as a kind of butcher with a lot of instinct and little charisma says longtime mafia observer francesco la licata a journalist working for la stampa newspaper giovanni brusca became part of a corleonesi death squad which reported directly to riina he became capo mandamento of san giuseppe jato after the arrest of his father in 1989 ruthless killer nothing better demonstrated brusca s ruthlessness than the kidnapping and murder of 11 year old giuseppe di matteo took part in the 1992 falcone killing and following his arrest under the pentito system named others involved in the plot brusca had the boy kidnapped in november 1993 according to the confession of one of the kidnappers gaspare spatuzza they dressed as police officers and told the boy he was being taken to see his father who at that time was being kept under police protection on mainland italy instead they held the boy for 26 months during which time they tortured him and sent grisly photos to his father in an attempt to force him to retract his testimony di matteo made a desperate trip to sicily to try to negotiate his son s release but the boy was finally strangled on the orders of brusca subsequently he had the body dissolved in a barrel of acid to prevent the family being able to mourn at a proper funeral this deliberate added indignity of concealing or destroying the victim s body is known colloquially as the lupara bianca it also hinders investigation by destroying evidence di matteo told the judge i guarantee my collaboration but to this animal i guarantee nothing if you leave me alone with him for two minutes i ll cut off his head giovanni brusca was one of the most powerful mafia leaders between riinas arrest in january 1993 and his own in may 1996 he was involved in the campaign of terror in 1993 against the state to get them to back off in their crackdown against the mafia after the murders of anti mafia magistrates giovanni falcone and paolo borsellino following the months after riina s arrest there were a series of bombings by the corleonesi against several tourist spots on the italian mainland the via dei georgofili in florence via palestro in milan and the piazza san giovanni in laterano and via san teodoro in rome which left 10 people dead and 71 injured as well as severe damage to centres of cultural heritage such as the uffizi gallery arrest on may 20 1996 then aged thirty nine brusca was arrested in a small house in with his girlfriend their young son and his brother vincenzo his sister in law and their two children the investigators were able to pinpoint their exact location when the noise of a plainclothes officer driving by the house on a motorbike was picked up by officers listening to a call intercepted on brusca s cellular phone when brusca was hurried into palermo s police station some 90 minutes after the arrest dozens of police officers cheered honked their horns and embraced each other as the scruffy bearded brusca emerged from a car clad in dirty jeans and a rumpled white shirt some ripped off their ski masks as if to say they no longer had anything to fear from the mafia one reportedly managed to slip past guards and punched brusca in the face brusca had received a life sentence the previous year after being convicted in absentia of murder and he was subsequently convicted of the bomb attack that killed the anti mafia magistrate giovanni falcone near capaci in court brusca admitted detonating the bomb planted remote control while watching the magistrates convoy through binoculars from a hill collaborating with italian justice after his arrest brusca started to collaborate initially his collaboration met with scepticism fearing his repentance could be a ruse to escape the harsh prison terms reserved for ranking mafia bosses under question was whether the state should offer not only protection but also a salary and the promise of judicial leniency to a man nicknamed u verru the pig who had punished a mafia pentito by dissolving the body of his 11 year old son in an acid bath in the first three months much of what brusca said turned out to be either unverifiable or false and a growing chorus of politicians called for a tightening of the whole collaboration system despite having confessed numerous murders and other criminal activities he was not granted the status of full collaborator until february 1999 until that time brusca was described as a dichiarante or talking witness although much of his evidence eventually was was part of a strategy to emasculate other pentiti and subvert the course of justice brusca has offered a controversial version of the capture of tot riina a secret deal between carabinieri officers secret agents and cosa nostra bosses tired of the dictatorship of the corleonesi according to brusca bernardo provenzano sold riina in exchange for the valuable archive of compromising material that riina held in his apartment in via bernini 52 in palermo brusca also claimed that riina had told him that after the assassination of falcone he had been in indirect negotiations with interior minister nicola mancino on a deal to prevent any further killings mancino later said this was not true but in july 2012 mancino was ordered to stand trial for withholding evidence on 1992 talks between the italian state and the mafia and the killings of falcone and borsellino in 2004 it was reported that brusca was allowed out of prison for one week every forty five days to see his family a reward for his good behaviour as well as becoming an informant victims were angry at such seemingly soft treatment for a multiple killer assets confiscated the brusca family land was seized by the government and in 2000 handed over to an organization called the consortium for legal development it restores property confiscated from imprisoned mafiosi and gives them back to the community the small stone farmhouse at san giuseppe jato some 40 minutes from palermo was renovated in 2004 it is sicilys first anti mafia agriturismo or farmstay tourists can enjoy organic pasta milled from wheat grown on bruscas land and organic wine made from his vineyards by the placido rizzotto cooperative named after the union leader from corleone who was shot by the mafia in 1948 according to lucio guarino the organizations director returning the properties sends a powerful message the brusca family controlled the fortunes of this territory for nearly thirty years so its an incredible symbol here land equals power and this project shows that with the will of the people its possible to confiscate and restore mafia land it has not been first year after the cooperative had

several sets of forms and genres this article provides a short summary of the full spectrum of critical amp academic writing and lists the genres of academic writing it does not cover the variety of critical approaches that can be applied when one writes about a subject however as harwood and hadley 2004 and hyland 2004 have pointed out the amount of variation that exists between different disciplines may mean that we can not refer to a single academic literacy writing in these forms or styles is usually written in an impersonal and dispassionate tone targeted for a critical and informed audience based on closely investigated knowledge and intended to reinforce or challenge concepts or arguments it usually circulates within the academic world the academy but the academic writer may also find an audience outside via journalism speeches pamphlets etc typically scholarly writing has an objective stance clearly states the significance so that other scholars may try to replicate the results strong papers are not overly general and correctly utilize formal academic rhetoric while academic writing consists of a number of text types and genres what they have in common the conventions that academic writers traditionally follow has been a subject of debate many writers have called for conventions to be challenged for example pennycook 1997 and ivanic 1998 while others suggest that some conventions should be maintained for example clark 1997 p136 discourse community a discourse community is essentially a group of people that shares mutual interests and beliefs it establishes limits and regularities who may speak what may be spoken and how it is to be said in addition rules prescribe what is true and false what is reasonable and what foolish and what is meant and what not porter 39 people are generally involved in a variety of discourse communities within their private social and professional established boundaries while others may have a looser construction with greater freedom additionally discourse communities have approved channels of communication in which members write or speak through these channels can be a web page a journal a blog or any medium people use to communicate through examples of discourse communities may include but certainly not limited to medicine law psychology films movies general forums technology sociology philosophy chemistry physics mathematics writing rhetoric and composition the concept of discourse community is vital to academic writers across nearly all disciplines for the academic writers purpose is to influence a discourse community to think a little bit differently at the same time the discourse community does not expect to see any writing that appears too foreign for this reason the academic writer must follow the constraints see article section below set by the discourse community so his or her ideas earn approval and respect discourse community constraints constraints are the discourse communitys written how he or she can say it they define what is an acceptable argument each discourse community expects to see a writer construct his or her argument using their conventional style of language and vocabulary and they expect a writer to use the established intertext within the discourse community as the building blocks for his or her argument academic writing writing for a discourse community in order for a writer to become familiar with some of the constraints of the discourse community they are writing for a useful tool for the academic writer is to analyze prior work from the discourse community the writer should look at the textual moves in these papers focusing on how they are constructed across most discourses communities writers will establish the novelty of their position make a claim or thesis acknowledge prior work and situate their claim in a disciplinary context offer warrants for one s view based on community specific arguments and procedures hyland each of the moves listed above are constructed differently depending on the discourse community the claim is made in a high school paper would look very different from the way a claim is made in a college composition class it is important for the academic writer to familiarize himself or herself with the conventions of the discourse community by reading and analyzing other works so that the writer is best able to communicate his or her ideas porter contrary to some beliefs this is by no means plagiarism writers should also be aware of other ways in which the discourse community shapes their writing other functions of the discourse community include determining what makes a novel argument and what a fact is the following sections elaborate on these functions misconceptions fact and opinion in the discourse community it is important for any writer to distinguish between what is accepted as fact and what is accepted as opinion wikipedias article fact misguides writers in their interpretation of what a fact actually is the article states that a fact derived from the latin factum see below is something that has 28 0 toolong but this is not how writers think of facts writing professionals hold that in a rhetorical argument a fact is a claim that an audience will accept as being true without requiring proof facts can be thought of merely as claims the audience can be thought of as a discourse community and a fact can suddenly change to become an opinion if stated in a different discourse community this is how writers within discourse communities manage to present new ideas to their communities any new opinion would need to be proven by making a rhetorical argument in which the writer would weave together what his or her intended audience will accept as facts in a way that supports his or her idea therefore knowing the intended discourse community is a very important part of writing across discourse communities what is considered factual may fluctuate across each community as elizabeth wardle and douglas downs wrote in their book writing about writing in reference to margaret kantzs article helping students use argument within discourse communities writers build on top of the ideas established by previous writers one of the most common misconceptions about writing is the idea of the lonely writer that great writers papers are filled almost entirely with original ideas and messages but this is simply not the case discourse communities introduce new ideas and claims and from these writers expand on them james porter a scholar of rhetoric at indiana university uses the declaration of independence as an example to illustrate this point porter points out that jefferson merely pulled the phrase that all men are created equal straight from his commonplace book he made as a boy porter also points out that life liberty and the pursuit of happiness was a cliche of the times appearing in numerous political documents in fact according to porter almost nothing in the declaration of independence was written originally by jefferson jefferson wrote this great work by weaving together the intertext of his discourse community as greene describes in his thought of metaphorically as a conversation between those in the discourse community the metaphor of conversation emphasizes the social nature of writing greene just like in a conversation when you listen to the ideas of the others who are involved and formulate your own opinion on the topic a writer may be reading a paper done by another writer in the discourse community and from this paper the scholar may obtain inspiration to expand the claims expressed in the paper or address them from other angles like the verbal conversations you have with others effective arguments never take place in a vacuum they take into account previous conversations that have taken place about the subject under discussion greene good academic writers know the importance of researching previous work from within the discourse community and using this work to build their own claims by taking these ideas and expanding upon them or applying them in a new way a writer is able to make their novel argument intertextuality in academic writing intertextuality is the text the term intertextuality was coined in 1966 by julia kristeva all texts are necessarily related to prior texts through a network of links writers often unwittingly make use of what has previously been written and thus some degree of borrowing is inevitable this generally occurs within a specific discourse community conversation factoring in intertextuality the goal of academic writing is not simply creating new ideas but to offer a new perspective and link between already established ideas this is why gathering background information and having past knowledge is so important in academic writing a common metaphor used to describe academic writing is entering the conversation a conversation that began long before you got there and will continue long after you leave a quote from kenneth burke encapsulates this metaphor intertextuality plays into this because without it there would be no conversations just hundreds of thousands of writings not connected or able to build on each other the listening until you can join the conversation can be seen as doing research all instead of self knowledge this can be connected to the part of the metaphor where no one in the parlor is qualified to bring you up to speed just as the papers your researched were researched also types of intertextuality there are two distinct types of intertextuality as defined by porter iterability and presupposition iterability is the capability of a text to be reiterated and repeated in various contexts iterability is explicitly seen in texts as opposed to presupposition which refers to assumptions a text makes one such example of this concept from porter is the declaration of independence many texts and ideas of different centuries were integrated into the one document jefferson took the idea of john lockes social contract theory the declaration of rights for virginia by george mason and the form of the english bill of rights in 1689 into the declaration of independence some claimed that this was blatant plagiarism but others say it was iterability he used the form of a list of grievances as used in the english bill quotes can be reiterated but also the form of a text when thomas jefferson proposed the declaration to congress they made 86 changes to his actual original ideas because they were so farfetched from the current discourse community this is an example of the constraint a discourse community can place on a text presupposition is the process by which implications are made without being specifically stated or explained within text these assumptions are usually extremely basic thoughts made by a vast majority of the audience such thoughts may be considered common sense or otherwise obvious to anyone who reads the text example rodrigo rode his bike to his friends house this simple statement implies several facts that the reader automatically assumes rodrigo owns a bike he has a friend his friend has a house his house is within biking distance and rodrigo has the ability to ride a bike details can be added or removed by an author to give more or less creative license to the readers themselves in this case one reader could believe it to be blue because the assumptions made by different readers can be drastically different from one another it is important that the framework the author provides is sufficient to keep the assumptions that are crucial to the story itself constant between readers example it was dark and stormy night this statement is iterated as a clich opening to a story the statement provides an opening for a fictional narrative while simultaneously implying an ominous foreboding setting when opening a story with this line the author is able to instantly set a mood and tone before the story truly begins giving the reader a sense that the story is already in progress examples of intertextuality 1 ulysses ulysses a novel written by james joyce in 1918 is an example of intertextuality because the themes largely shadow those of homers odyssey an ancient greek epic poem ulysses uses the plot line from the odyssey and retells it with a new character in a new setting thus using past writings to create the classic disney movie aladdin has many distinct examples of intertextuality throughout for example one scene depicts the genie that comes out of aladdins lamp being pinched by a crab the same crab from another popular disney movie the little mermaid in another scene the two main characters are flying through the sky on a magic carpet and for a moment zeuss temple from the movie hercules can be seen in the background these are examples of intertextuality because they pull from past disney works and use them to create something new and original 3 west side story west side story is an example of intertextuality in that it is the modern retelling of shakespeares tragedy of romeo amp juliet tony romeo and maria juliet are both in love however their families and the rival groups with which their loyalty lies forbid their love west side story uses themes from romeo and juliet such as forbidden love and a tragic ending to create a new original story a frame is the section in an academic paper in which a perspective that has already been accepted by a specific discourse community is presented in order to blatantly explain to the reader the point of view from which the rest of the essay will be analyzed because of the established framework the reader will logically understand the progression of the writers argument because the writer has legitimized his or her claim by citing an accepted theory framework and thus the reader will be directed towards a particular conclusion when one uses an academic concept that has been accepted by the discourse community as a frame this frame forces you to offer both a definition and description of the principle around which your argument develops greene as stuart greene explains framing is a metaphor for describing the lens or perspective from which writers present their arguments one can think of a frame as metaphorical glasses that are put on in order to see a topic in a new way for example if one is trying to put on the glasses of sigmund freud and approach said topic from his psychoanalytical point of view this frame has allowed the writer to see a topic from a particular angle this means that one may be disregarding the socioeconomic biological or other lenses from which one could view a particular topic you are using the one frame of psychoanalysis to shape your argument and make an impression on the reader an academic frame does not give the topic a bias per se as the argument is not presented in a false way the frame does however allow the writer to focus the readers attention in one specific direction in order to reach a specific conclusion see establishing a novel idea framing in the discourse community intertextuality establishing a place in the conversation a frame also establishes credibility for the author in a certain field of study or discourse community a discourse community can be composed of medical professionals historians or even the individuals that make up the author is telling the discourse community that he or she is aware of what is current in the discourse and that the paper being presented has something relevant to add without a frame a paper is not grounded in any particular community and thus has no academic relevance or any legitimate importance to an academic audience the framing concept that one chooses to use has already been accepted by the community and is thus a part of their intertextual matrix a well developed frame is the doorway into an academic conversation that has been going on for quite some time before ones arrival and is still vigorously in progress after the new argument has been established burke qtd in greene if one guides the members of a specific discourse through a paper using an idea that the community already holds as true the new argument is more likely to gain acceptance from the audience as they understand where it is coming from establishing a novel idea a paper is not about the frame itself the purpose of an frame it but rather to use the frame as a tool a pair of glasses to see a unique claim as molded in a certain light no text stands alone as the individual writers work is part of a web part of a community search for truth and meaning porter in essence a writer does not randomly come up with new ideas but writes about already established concepts in novel ways this is where the frame comes in without a frame an author is simply making a statement one which has most likely already been made throughout the history of the topic or within the discourse however a frame gives you a way to look at your statement an explanation for phenomena and therefore questions to ask and research it is the frame that allows one to establish the argument because it gives a tired topic new life or novelty warning do nt get lost in the scholars voice many people have trouble creating a new claim out they read them as stories kantz by doing so one could accidentally wind up regurgitating information that a scholarly article explains instead of using the information or concepts read as a frame to further develop ones own argument make sure to relate the framework back to your original claim the issue that you are addressing again the frame is not the central focus of a paper but rather a point of view from which to examine a topic by incorporating this scholarly information into your paper and relating it to your own claim you are maintaining the novelty of your argument example framework and analysis this section will guide one through an example of framework as it is being used in a published academic paper one will observe how the sections on framework written above apply to a real world example the following excerpt is from an essay by first year writing student shannon baldo entitled elves and extremism the use of fantasy in the radical environmentalist movement this essay was written for under the section entitled first year writing all articles in the young scholars in writing journal focus on some aspect of rhetoric or the art of persuasion in speaking and writing in shannon baldos essay the frame of fantasy themed criticism is immediately defined in the introduction of her essay baldo quickly explains ernest g bormanns academically accepted idea of fantasy themed criticism to include first that a persons reality is created by communication and language and second that this communication can create a shared reality among many participantsthat allows them to see themselves as heroes or villains and their actions as just or unjust foss qtd in baldo when observing the extreme environmentalist movement on a whole one may conclude that environmental extremists are naturally crazy driven to rage as they were not given enough attention as children etc by choosing the framework of fantasy themed criticism baldo is narrowing this field of frames down to one way of viewing the movement she then uses specifics about the movement as seen in their literature to explain that it is fantasy rhetoric that affects the environmentalist movement specifically as observed in the selected paragraph above baldo uses the framework of fantasy themed criticism to argue her own topic it is the fantasy themed rhetoric of the environmental movement that allows environmentalists to justify their radical actions baldo does not focus her paper on fantasy themed criticism in general but uses it as a skeleton upon which to mold her argument about environmentalism specifically without bormanns concept being accepted within the discourse community baldo would not have had the credibility with which to speak to an academic audience or a way in which to argue her point instead she would have only been able to state her opinion academic document types book in many types and varieties chapter

along with fred reinfeld and i a horowitz they were the most likely to be stocked in aggregate by book stores on the chess shelf even later when he produced more advanced books book stores stocked several of his efforts because they were steady sellers pandolfini created and or popularized several innovations in chess instructional writing of the time for various publishing reasons it is common for chess authors to list several moves before they include a diagram pandolfini realized that beginning players struggle with that format and most of his books include more and larger diagrams to help the beginning player orient pandolfini also worked on summarizing chess principles into small phrases that could be for example the book russian chess contains capsule quotes by famous players highlighting broad conceptual themes pandolfini also realized that garry kasparov was an exciting personality to hold the title of world chess champion and produced some books which drew upon that feel of freshness in the chess community examples are kasparov s winning chess tactics and kasparov and deep blue he was portrayed by ben kingsley in the 1993 film searching for bobby fischer based on the book of the same name by fred waitzkin pandolfini lives in new york and has coached many talented chess players the most famous being fabiano caruana the youngest grandmaster in american history josh waitzkin the subject of the book and movie mentioned above and chess prodigy jeff sarwer who became the under 10 champion in the first world youth chess championship when he was 8 years old pandolfini is popular with his students due to his easygoing attitudea sharp contrast to the stern character kingsley portrayed in the film he writes a monthly titled the abc s of chess this column

field of mass communication studies he has published extensively in the field of political communication and communication theory best known is his contribution to the education of the public concerning communication theory his work has centered on explaining communication theories and their applications he is adamant about informing the public on the benefits and dangers of mass communication the amsterdam school of communication research ascor established the denis mcquail award in his honor which is awarded each year to the best article advancing communication theory since 2006 mcquail is emeritus professor at the university of amsterdam and visiting professor in the department of politics at the university of southampton in the early 1980s he and dr sven windahl published a book communication models the book details basic communication models lasswell model shannon and weaver s model gerbner s model media systems in general in textbook style the book outlines each topic it is a compilation of existing communication theories with the author s own thoughts he and co author sven windahl spent a great deal of time on it but at the time it was nothing more than a book of theories mcquail s next book discusses in greater detail the mass communication concept specifically it talks about the significance of mass media and how it affects the individual and society rather than focusing on the definitions of the models in general the three primary objectives to update and take account of recent theory and research enlargement to reflect the continuing expansion of the field clarification and improved presentation pg 13 in chapter 10 mcquail discusses the future of mass communication and states that it is either socially fragmenting or unifying he makes several points on how the media needs to be socially responsible in order to be effective the sequel was media performance theories are taken more for granted and applied he discusses at length the importance of an informed public he states that the more aware a public is the less likely it will be affected by media theory freedom versus control denis mcquail believes the relations between media and society both have political and social cultural aspects vital to the political aspect is the question of freedom and control the newspaper press establishes its claim to freedom entirely on its political purpose of conveying opinions and spreading political and financial information the television and radio uses political purposes of the newspaper and provides information based on a general public interest as the television industry increases market controls replaces political power new media networks as denis mcquail believes is still awaiting classifications of their amount of political freedom on the basis of privacy or content being distributed to individual users opposed to mass distribution denis mcquail also believes new media needs regulations to avoid misuse of monopoly power the degree of control in the views of denis mcquails suggests likelihood of utilizing it denis mcquail also believes as new media broadens freedom of communication the controls of continual organizations alongside the market in regards to flow and reception should not be underestimated the use and reception of media mcquail makes special mention in mass communication theory of the difficulty that surrounds identifying specific uses of media as well as the difficulty of understanding the reception that any specific medium may have mcquail uses the medium of the television as an example and notes that despite the many changes and extensions that the occurred the television is still primarily seen as a medium of family entertainment the topic of interactivity is also breached in the book with mcquail suggesting that the degree of interactivity is yet another defining feature that confuses the useful purpose and reception of mass media forms major publications

born in chiswick the son of a baker he made his first appearance on the stage in the title role of oroonoko at drury lane in 1755 john palmer richard yates and susanna cibber being in the cast he played under david garrick and was the original florizel in the latter s adaptation of shakespeare s the winter s tale garrick thought highly of him and wrote a eulogistic epitaph for his monument in chiswick church his nephew charles holland 17681849 was also an actor who played with sarah siddons and edmund kean holland died from smallpox at the age of 36 he did not marry but was engaged to jane pope literary accounts of the betrothal were given by james smith and then john doran sources notes attribution the tara brooch is a celtic brooch of about 700 ad generally considered to be the most impressive of over 50 elaborate irish brooches to have been discovered it was found in 1850 and rapidly recognised as one of the most important works of early christian irish insular art it is now displayed in the national museum of ireland in dublin history created in about 700 ad the seven inch long pseudo penannular brooch is composed primarily of silver gilt and is embellished with intricate abstract decoration including interlace on both front and back it was made in many pieces with much of the decoration on small trays or panels which were then fixed into place when it was found only one panel of decoration was missing but several more have now disappeared apparently before 1872 when it entered the collection of the royal irish academy who later transferred their collection of antiquities to the new national museum the design the techniques of workmanship including filigree and inlaying and the gold silver and exemplify the advanced state of goldsmithing in ireland in the seventh century the brooch has a pseudo penannular form like most brooches of the period it contains neither christian nor pagan religious motifs and was made for a wealthy patron almost certainly male who wanted a personal expression of status it is probably the most spectacular and one of the best preserved of several dozen high status brooches found in britain or ireland but mostly in ireland although similar in style each has a completely individual design in detail precious metals are used but only semiprecious stones although the brooch is named after the hill of tara traditionally seen as the seat of the high kings of ireland the tara brooch has no connection to either the hill of tara or the high kings of ireland the brooch was supposedly found in august 1850 on the beach at bettystown near laytown county meath some 50 km 30 mi north of dublin the finder a peasant woman found it in a box buried in the sand though many think it was in fact found inland and she claimed it was found at the beach to avoid a legal claim by the landowner it was sold to a dealer and then to the dublin jeweller george waterhouse who was already producing celtic revival jewellery and who renamed it the tara brooch to make it more appealing celtic revival jewellery had become very fashionable over the previous decade and the discovery of the brooch could hardly have been better timed from this point of view the brooch was immediately recognised as the culminating masterpiece though early in date of the irish development of large and superbly worked ornate brooches a status it has retained ever since waterhouse used it as the centre of displays of his replicas and imitations of celtic brooches in his dublin shop also exhibiting it at the great exhibition in london in 1851 and the paris exposition universelle as well as the dublin exhibition visited by the queen in 1853 victoria had already seen for her inspection waterhouse had invented the brooch s name choosing to link it to the site associated with the high kings of ireland fully aware that this would feed the irish middle class fantasy of being descended from them by the time the brooch passed to what is now the national museum of ireland in the 1870s tara brooch had become a generic term for celtic revival brooches some of which were now being made by indian workshops for export to europe birthplace

surface is saturated with craters almost all of which were formed by impacts history the word crater was adopted by galileo from the greek word for vessel a greek vessel used to mix wine and water galileo built his first telescope in late 1609 and turned it to the moon for the first time on november 30 1609 he discovered that contrary to general opinion at that time the moon was not a perfect sphere but had both mountains and cup like depressions the latter of which he gave the name craters scientific opinion as to the origin of craters swung back and forth over the ensuing centuries the competing theories were a volcanic eruptions blasting holes in the moon b meteoric impact c a theory known as the welteislehre developed in germany between the two world wars which suggested glacial action creating the unmanned spacecraft of the same period proved conclusively that meteoric impact or impact by asteroids for larger craters was the origin of almost all lunar craters and by implication most craters on other bodies as well the formation of new craters is studied in the lunar impact monitoring program at nasa the biggest recorded creation was caused by an impact recorded on march 17 2013 the explosion which was visible with the naked eye is believed to be from an approximately 40 kg meteoroid hitting the moon with a speed of 90000 km h characteristics because of the moon s lack of water and atmosphere or tectonic plates there is little erosion and craters are found that exceed two billion years in age the age of large craters is determined by the number of smaller craters contained within it older craters generally accumulating more small contained craters the smallest craters found have been microscopic in size found in rocks returned to earth from the moon the largest crater called such is lunar south pole however it is believed that many of the lunar maria were formed by giant impacts with the resulting depression filled by upwelling lava craters typically will have some or all of the following features a surrounding area with materials splashed out of the ground when the crater was formed this is typically lighter in shade than older materials due to exposure to solar radiation for a lesser time raised rim consisting of materials ejected but landing very close by crater wall the downward sloping portion of the crater crater floor a more or less smooth flat area which as it ages accumulates small craters of its own central peak found only in some craters with a diameter exceeding 16 mi this is generally a splash effect caused by the kinetic energy of the impacting object being turned to heat and melting some lunar material lunar crater categorization in 1978 chuck wood and leif andersson of the lunar amp planetary lab devised a system of categorization of lunar impact craters locations of the location of the named crater feature on the near side of the moon gallery image location of albategnius crater jpg center

1400 or 1410 amp ndash 1451 was a german painter working in the late gothic style he was active in cologne germany and is best known for the altar of the city patrons triptych painted for the town hall chapel in the 1440s and now in cologne cathedral lochner was one of the most important german artist before albrecht drer an artist who held lochner in great esteem and is most identified with continuing his legacy lochner was one the last major painters working in the soft style weicher still of the international gothic tradition his work is known for its clean appearance virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography he was praised by friedrich schlegel and goethe for the sweetness and grace of his madonna portraits his paintings combine a gothic tendency towards long flowing lines in brilliant colours with a flemish influenced realism and attention to detail lochner s compositions often include fanciful angels singing and playing musical instruments of monumental works he seems to have had knowledge of metal work given his realistic deceptions of objects such as the magi s gifts in the cologne altarpiece life the known details of lochner life are extremely scant he is thought to have come from meersburg near lake constance as his parents georg and alhet are recorded as having died there in 1451 however his style bears no traces of the art of that region his talent was recognised from an early age and he trained as a painter in the netherlands under a master whose name is now lost while there he may have been influenced by the work of jan van eyck and rogier van der weyden elements of their styles can be detected in his later works although neither is thought to be the master under whom he had studied lochner had moved to cologne by 1442 when he was commissioned by the city council for decorations in connection with the celebration of the visit of emperor frederick iii he in the city were he was known as maister steffan lochner bought a house around 1442 with his wife lysbeth in 1444 he was able to afford to sell it for a larger property near saint alban church he was elected town councilor by the painters guild in 1447 and 1450 around 1447 he seems to have encountered financial difficulties forcing him to re mortgage his house there are no surviving records of him after christmas 1451 his parents died at the end of that year and it is known he was unable to travel to meersburg to attend to their will and estate it is presumed he was then already ill and died shortly thereafter cologne was undergoing an outbreak of plague that year and the area lochner was living in was particularly affected however it is not know if this was his cause of death work there are no signed paintings by lochner and no works were attributed to the historical person until j f bhmer identified him with the painter of the article published in 1823 he based his attribution on a mention of a visit to cologne in 1520 in the diary of albrecht drer during a recount of the earlier artist paying to see an altarpiece by maister steffan bhmer identified this as the altar of the city patrons and maister steffan as the documented stefan lochner over the years on stylistic grounds others paintings have been attributed to him however in recent years some art historians have questioned that the diary entry was authentically made by drer he gave his figures the common idealised facial features traditional of early medieval portraiture esdically his female subjects have the usual high foreheads long noses small rounded chins tucked blond curls and prominent ears typically of late gothic he sets these rather traditional characters within innovative and highly active monumental settings the main feature that defines his work as superior lochner s major works were polyptychs which like many 15th century religious pieces were over the centuries broken apart there are two dated versions of the presentation in the temple one in the calouste gulbenkian museum 1445 and another in the hessisches landesmuseum darmstadt 1447 two wings from an altarpiece with images of saints now in the national gallery are in london and the wallraf richartz

in the rose bower c 1448 wallraf richartz museum cologne gallery the symphony no 7 in c major op 105 was the final published symphony of jean sibelius completed in 1924 the seventh is notable for being a one movement symphony in contrast to the standard symphonic formula of four movements it has been described as completely original in form subtle in its handling of tempi individual in its treatment of key and wholly organic in growth and sibelius s most remarkable compositional achievement after sibelius finished its composition on march 2 1924 the work was premiered in stockholm on march 24 as fantasia sinfonica no 1 a symphonic fantasy the composer was apparently undecided on what name to give the piece and only granted it status as a symphony after some deliberation for its publication on february 25 1925 the score was titled symphony no 7 in one movement composition the concept of a continuous single movement symphony was one sibelius only reached after a long process of experimentation his symphony no plans for this symphony as involving joy of life and vitality with appassionato sections the symphony would have three movements the last being a hellenic rondo surviving sketches from the early 1920s show that the composer was working on a work of four not three movements the overall key seems to have been g minor while the second movement an adagio in c major provided much of the material for the themes that eventually made up the symphony the first surviving draft of a single movement symphony dates from 1923 suggesting that sibelius may have made the decision to dispense with a multi movement work at this time through the summer of 1923 the composer produced several further drafts at least one of which is in a performable state however the ending of the symphony was not yet fully worked out as 1923 turned into 1924 sibelius was distracted from his work on the symphony by a number of outside events the award of a large cash prize from a helsinki foundation brief piano works when he returned to the seventh the composer drank copious amounts of whisky in order he claimed to steady his hand as he wrote on the manuscript paper along with his fifth and sixth symphonies the seventh was sibelius s final home for material from kuutar a never completed symphonic poem whose title roughly means moon spiritess this work helped to shape the earliest parts of the seventh those created during the composition of the fifth and sixth one of the themes from kuutar called thtl where the stars dwell evolved into part of the seventh s opening adagio section importance although the seventh apparently first existed in embryonic form in d major it eventually attained the home key of c major there was a time when composing in c was considered fruitlessit had nothing more to offer but in response to the seventh the british composer ralph vaughan williams said that only sibelius could make c major seventh in the segerstam chandos cycle of sibelius symphonies calls the dramatic conclusion the grandest celebration of c major there ever was sibelius lived for 33 years after finishing the seventh but it was one of the last works he composed he did complete one more important orchestral work his symphonic poem tapiola however despite much evidence of work on an eighth symphony it is believed that sibelius burned whatever he had written he left the seventh to stand as his final statement on symphonic form form the form of the seventh symphony is startlingly original since the time of joseph haydn a movement in a symphony would typically be unified by an approximately constant tempo and would attain variety by use of contrasting themes in different keys sibelius turned this scheme on its head the seventh symphony is unified by the key of c every significant passage in the work is in c major or c minor and variety is achieved by an almost constantly changing tempo texture sibelius had done something similar in the fifth symphony s first movement which combines elements of a standard symphonic first movement with a faster scherzo however the seventh symphony contains much wider variety within one movement instrumentation 2 flutes both switch to piccolo during the central adagio 2 oboes 2 clarinets in b flat 2 bassoons 4 horns in f 3 trumpets in b flat 3 trombones timpani and strings description adagio bb 1 92 the symphony begins with a soft roll on the timpani followed by a slow ascending syncopated c major scale starting on the timpani s g in the strings which leads to an unexpected chord in the remote key of a minor the interval of a minor sixth between the initial note of g and the final note of e has been interpreted as a reference to the beginning of wagner s tristan und isolde the passage is followed by chords taken from that work announced quietly on the flute and repeated on the clarinet we soon arrive at a passage sounding rather like a chorale with the violas and cellos softly singing a hymn like tune that will gradually build up to the first climax of the symphony as the climax approaches the orchestra adds volume and intensity at the climax the first trombone announces the main tune of the symphony labelled aino in sketches after the composer s wife this theme reappears at key moments of the symphony each time reaffirming c as the tonality un pochett meno adagio amp ndash poco affrett amp ndash poco a poco affrettando il tempo al vivacissimo amp ndash rallentando al bb 93 221 at bar 93 the tempo is marked un pochett meno adagio read un pochettino meno adagio a little less slowly a new theme in the dorian mode based on the ascending scale in the opening bars soon appears on the oboe the tempo gradually long sequential passage exploring several tonalities at bar 134 the time signature slips from 3 2 into 6 4 notching up the tension the key signature switches to c minor soon the tempo is ratcheted up to vivacissimo very lively with fast staccato chords traded between the strings and woodwind the music turns stormy in mood with ominous ascending and descending scales on the strings while the aino theme is heard again in the brass adagio amp ndash poco a poco meno lento al bb 222 257 allegro molto moderato amp ndash un pochett affrettando bb 258 285 allegro moderato amp ndash poco a poco meno moderato bb 286 408 vivace bb 409 448 presto amp ndash poco a poco rallentando al bb 449 475 adagio bb 476 495 largamente molto amp ndash affettuoso bb 496 521 this section ends with a chord progression from a back to the symphony s main key of c major taken from kuolema tempo i bb 522 525 the last four measures return to the initial adagio tempo logically this ought to be faster than the preceding music which was adagio then largamente molto broadening that is slowing a lot but most conductors slow down the strings play a version of the theme from bars 11 12 against a grand c major chord held by the brass and woodwinds lionel pike describes the d to c note progression followed by the b enharmonically equivalent to c to c progression in the strings as being the final resolution of the tonal dissonance created by the striking a minor chord from near the beginning of the work also for example the dissonant a resolves to consonant g in the immediately preceding section the d to c note progression is also the first two notes of the trombone s recurring aino theme arnold whittall describes this ending as platform 1 island platform holmview is a railway station on the beenleigh line of brisbane australia it is

single out evolution in classrooms this law would also require them to teach beliefs that may contradict their own personal views conversely the lack of this law may allow professors to retaliate via

maratha empire north of the deccan plateau in the vicinity of melghat tiger reserve amravati district maharashtra it was successfully assaulted by an anglo indian force commanded by arthur wellesley on the 15 december 1803 during the second anglo maratha war in popular culture the campaign to take gawilghur forms the background of the novel sharpe s fortress by bernard cornwell the third in a series of books covering the eponymous hero s time in the british army in india during the napoleonic era history the fort takes its name from the gawli cow herds who inhabited the berar modern day amravati for centuries earlier the fort was likely just made of mud as were several such areas in the region the exact date of construction is not known but the persian historian firishta records that ahmed shah wali the ninth king of the muzaffarid dynasty built gawilgarh when he was encamped at ellichpur fortification was carried out in 1803 during the 2nd maratha war the fort was besieged by arthur wellesley later duke of wellington after two failed attempts at the main gate by british and sepoy companies and many casualties captain campbell led the 94th scottish brigade light company up the ravine dividing the inner and outer forts and into the inner fort by escalade the scots then forced the northern gatehouse and opened the many gates allowing the remaining british forces entry the british suffered few casualties in the final assault approx 150 the fortress was returned to the marathas after making peace with the british but they abandoned it major features the fort has several inscriptions in persian recording the date of building of each of its seven gates it has two water tanks devtalav and khantalav which would have been the main water source in case the fort was besieged within the fort the ruins of a mosque are the the inner fort and is built in the pathan style of architecture the mosque has a square canopy with intricate stone lattice work and a seven arched faade the mosque originally had two minarets only one of which is intact today gafur ahmed a jaglia tenant of the narnala fort tried to determine whether the chambers built into the fort of narnala had any use by driving 20 sheep into them one of the sheep turned up at gawilgarh which is more than 20 miles away so probably there is an underground tunnel connecting the two forts there are several unrepaired breaches made by british guns which remain to this day the gun that killed five attackers with a single shot still stands although now with graffiti running the length of the barrel

at luonnonmaan telakka naantali finland in 1989 plans were made for converting the ship to a combined car passenger train ferry but these were abandoned in the summer of 1990 the wellamo briefly served on the helsinkistockholm route because the new silja serenade was not yet complete but old ms finlandia had to be delivered to her new owners dfds during the same year effoa and johnson line merged to form effjohn who now became the effjohn planned a large scale reconstruction of gts finnjet however the company could not gather enough funds to realise this project instead the money was used to rebuild the svea and wellamo in 1992 wellamo was docked and rebuild at lloyds werft bremerhaven germany most notable exterior changes were a new skybar in front of the funnel and a new more blue dominated livery following the reconstruction the wellamo was renamed ms silja festival her sister having become ms silja karneval around the same time her homeport was changed from helsinki to mariehamn silja festival initially the silja festival continued on the same route as before alongside her sister but following the acquisition of ms silja europa and the subsequent fleet re

and written by werner herzog and zak penn the small cast film follows herzog and his crew gabriel beristain russell williams ii while working on the production of a movie project on the loch ness monster entitled enigma of loch ness it won the new american cinema award at the 2004 seattle international film festival plot after a mysterious shot of a body floating in loch ness reprised near the end incident at loch ness flashes back to the beginning of a documentary called herzog in wonderland being directed by john bailey with an overview of herzog s work as he himself begins work for a separate documentary to be called enigma of loch ness in which he is exploring the loch ness monster myth throughout the film herzog asserts the loch ness monster is merely a creation film continues herzog hosts a dinner party to kick off film production in attendance are his wife lena herzog several hollywood celebrities jeff goldblum ricky jay and the film s crew difficulties begin to arise as the untested producer zak penn attempts to transform herzog s film into a high grossing blockbuster in this attempt penn commits several hollywood clichs such as hiring a beautiful woman kitana baker for a dubious role as a sonar operator and a self deluded cryptozoologist michael karnow for comic relief as the shooting progresses the tension between herzog and penn escalates with each revelation that penn is acting in an underhanded manner first it becomes quite apparent the producer has commissioned a fake nessie to be used then both kitana and karnow are revealed to be actors hired by penn in a twist of events when herzog and his crew are working on their film the crew begins to see what appears to truly be the loch ness monster herzog boat s motor fails and then the monster appears to be attacking the vessel in a deepening fog the crew huddles below decks until the monster returns again to ram the boat hard enough to cause it to begin to sink karnow is thrown overboard during another attack nessie now clearly visible to the crew karnow is lost in the fog and presumably eaten by the monster after penn and the assistant director ad robert o meara sneak away in the liferaft herzog decides to put on the ship s sole wetsuit and swim to shore for help before he can do so however nessie returns to finally sink the ship while holding a camera in a water resistant housing herzog captures underwater images of a large creature passing him in the murky dark water the next day penn is found by vacationers on holiday and leads them back to recover all but o meara and karnow who are presumed dead at this point it appears that both the documentary film we have make could be fictitious however this never becomes completely obvious and the film ends without making it clear exactly who is duping whom production the entire movie is actually a mockumentary 32 4423 toolong invented by penn the ruse is revealed in easter eggs hidden on the dvd penn wrote what he calls a scriptment part script part treatment that outlined the specific structure of the film and including key dialogue that was needed in order to advance the plot but left most of the dialogue and interaction up to the participants to work out as improvisation as shown on the dvd the hoax was on even before photography started as several media outlets announced the upcoming production as an actual film adding to the verisimilitude is the fact that everyone who appears on screen is a real person and most are in fact who they say they are for example dp gabriel beristain and soundman russell williams ii are well known distinguished professionals who did work on the productions they respectively name on screen scored a rating of 62 on rotten tomatoes based on 47 reviews it also received a score of 62 on metacritic based on 20 critics indicating generally favorable reviews critic roger ebert enjoyed the film giving it 3 stars out of 4 saying watching the movie is an entertaining exercise in forensic viewing and the insidious thing is even if it is a con who is the conner and who is the connee kenneth turan of the los angeles times called it an amusing mock documentary that spends considerable energy artfully trying to make you believe it s real as real can be references floorheight entrylevelorstep weight 75550 lb deceleration the r62a is a new york

cases large and or formal enough to have a specific name such as a cohors amicorum the word comes derives from com with ire go ancient roman religion comes was a common epithet or title added to the name as catholicism still does with jesus and much venerated saints such as in our lady of lourdes for a hero or a divinity as a way to mark a relationship with another divinity on constantine i s coinage the emperor is declared comes to sol invictus the unconquered sun conceived of as a god imperially bestowed court titles and various offices became a secular title given to trusted ex courtiers and others as a mark of imperial confidence developing into a formal rank deriving from the companions of alexander the great and rather equivalent to the hellenistic philos basilikos or the paladin title of a holy roman empire knight and a papal official and therefore the title was retained when one was appointed often promoted to a post away from court often in the field or provincial administration next it seemed logical to link it to specific charges calling for an incumbent of high rank and even to make it part of the official title as the imperial court grew in size and assimilated to itself all political influence the emperors established a casual practice of appointing loyal servants to various posts this process had already been utilized elsewhere as with the prefect of the praetorian guard and the amici principis as the imperial system expanded however new offices were needed and decentralization demanded change comes the comites often translated as counts though neither feudal nor hereditary became leading officials of the later roman empire they wielded posts of every description from the army to the civil service while never surrendering their direct links and access to the emperors constantine took the final step of certifying the posts as comites provinciarum counts of the provinces who were sent out alongside vicars in their dioceses so that they were permanent fixtures of imperial government they are listed in full for the beginning of the fifth century in the notitia dignitatum and a schematic map of comital military posts in english translation is available at the friesian project at later dates additional posts have been created the following are examples of the various types of comites at court or in the imperial domains several of the major departments of an imperial court and household had a chief styled comes with an of a governor these included comes dispositonum a deputy to the very powerful magister officiorum master of offices responsible for organizing the imperial calendar and preparing the correspondence for distribution to the proper offices for transcription comes domesticorum a vir illustris head of the domestici a corps of bodyguards of the emperor who were stationed in the imperial palace there were two of these comital commanders for the horse viz foot units comes domesticorum equitum vs comes domesticorum peditum comes privatae largitionis keeper of the privy purse answerable and subordinate to the comes rerum privatarum comes rerum privatarum powerful imperial officer responsible for the private estates or holdings of the emperor and his family res privata he maintained the properties and collected all monies from rent to the privy purse administered by the comes privatae largitionis comes sacrarum largitionum a vir illustris master of the sacred largess who operated the imperial finances he controlled all of the mints each led by a procurator was in chief of a long list of officials more procurators rationales praepositi who collected senatorial taxes custom duties and some land taxes was also responsible for the yields of the mines provided budgets for the civil service and armies and supplied all uniforms his competence also included several minor comites comes auri gold count comes sacrae vestis master of the wardrobe of the emperor three regional comites largitionum for italy africa illyricum a comes commerciorum for illyricum a comes metallorum per illyricum responsible for the region s gold mines exceptionally a gubernatorial position was styled actually one of the vicarii this count had control over the large and strategically important imperial diocese of the east supervising the governors of this major group of provinces but was himself under supervision of the praefectus praetorio orientis furthermore some less important section chiefs under the authority of otherwise styled high ranking territorial officials could be styled comes e g under the praefectus urbis of rome a vir illustris were a comes formarum a comes riparum et alvei tiberis et cloacarum count of the coast of the tiber

its original meaning a companion of the king a royal servant of high rank under the early frankish kings some comites did not exercise any definite functions they were merely attached to the king s person and executed his orders others filled the highest offices e g the comes palatii and comes stabuli survives in the title constable the kingdom was divided for administrative purposes into small areas called pagi hence french pays to the roman civitas at the head of the pagus was the comes corresponding to the german graf in full gaugraf the comes was appointed by the king and removable at his pleasure and was chosen originally from all classes sometimes from enfranchised serfs his essential functions were judicial and executive and in documents he is often described as the kings agent agens publicus or royal judge judex publicus fiscalis as the delegate of the executive power he had the right to military command in the king s name and to take all the measures necessary for the

connection with the german graf which originally meant servant compare the origins of the words knight or valet it is the more curious that the gerefa should end as a subservient reeve the graf as a noble count feudalism in the feudal tradition latin was often used especially in legal documents as sometimes sole official language so the rendering in latin was no less important than the original in the spoken vernacular thus comes has been used as the latin equivalent or part whether containing count or some other word etymologically derived from comes or in many other languages from graf

heidi and in the jucklins notes a magic sword is any mythological or fictional sword imbued with magical power to increase its strength or grant it other supernatural qualities the archetype originated in myth and legend and occurs regularly in fantasy fiction renowned swords appear in the folklore of every nation that used swords sometimes the sword is ascribed no powers of its own it is famous because it is the hero s sword or because of its origin as when a god gives it to the hero other swords keep their wielders safe or destroy their enemies a more localized motif is the sword that has been broken and must be reforged commonly found in northern europe such a sword symbolizes the initial defeat and loss of honor of its wielder subsequent victory and the restoration of honor is achieved by reforging it either at the wielder s hand or that of his heir history it is probably that the roots of the sentient weapon myths stem from ancient peoples belief that sword making and metallurgy was the forge fire was also given spiritual connotations a lump of earth was transformed into a shiny usable object that could be hammered into many shapes extending further from the transformation of ore into metal the difficulty of actually obtaining a quality blade which took intense concentration and skill added to its esoteric qualities while any blacksmith could manufacture a knife or an axehead only a swordsmith could create a high quality sword the secrets of doing so were jealously guarded as well as formulas for alloys the skill necessary to forge a balanced blade one which is not too brittle or too soft and able to hold a usefully sharp edge in the age before automated machines blast furnaces and the knowledge of molecular chemistry made the creation of a sword seem almost miraculous a few degrees too hot or too cold within a very limited temperature range which could only be discerned by the glowing hue of a hot billet could make or break a sword a lack of flux and quench the blade could ruin weeks of work thus the swordsmith almost felt like he was one with his work giving the process his complete devotion of concentration and thought this led to the belief that he was actually imbuing the blade with an essence of his spirit in japan the swordsmiths were so concerned with this belief that they would undergo purification rituals and meditation before even attempting to start a new blade for fear that they may inadvertently create an evil sword it is also important to note that in antiquity metal was used as money and thus a sword was a very expensive and highly prized item a sign of wealth status and given holy connotations in many cultures one would only have to see how they are referenced within the holy books of christians jews and muslims to make this point evident the vikings prized their swords above all other things handing them down from generation to generation and giving them names the value of the blade was not only that it was used in polynesian people such as the mori people later as the concept of demons spiritual possession and elementals entered the realm of mythological themes it was only a natural leap to attribute magical properties of the swords of folklore to indwelling spirits magic swords may exhibit various degrees of sentience from being merely influenced by the wielder to being able to think for itself or even control its owner biblical the bible relates in the book of genesis how god seeking to deter adam and eve from returning to the garden of eden placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubim and a flaming sword which turned every way by some accounts the cherubim are replaced with the archangel michael who wields a similar weapon king david was given the sword of the slain giant goliath by the priest ahimelech to which was attached extra biblical mythology and traditions in the book of revelation jesus is symbolically described wielding a double edged sword that proceeds out from his mouth the word of truth mythological arthurian in the legend of king arthur the king himself is related to two magical swords in most variants the first is the sword in the stone only arthur could draw it out thereby proving that he is the rightful king in some tales this is his only sword in most variants this sword was then broken and he receives from the lady of the lake a new sword called excalibur arguably the most famous of magic swords however in other variants excalibur itself is the sword in the stone it is not clear from the various accounts of the arthur legend whether excalibur itself was possessed of magical powers or merely had a magical origin though its scabbard protected its bearer from physical harm many interpretations of the legend appear to endow excalibur with a cutting strength and durability beyond that of ordinary weapons chinese ancient chinese mythology relates the tale of l dongbin who slew dragons with a magic in norse mythology the god frey possessed a magic sword that struck out at jotuns of its own accord many other swords appear in norse legend in the hands of heroes tyrfing appears in the hervarar saga svafrlami was the king of gardariki and a grandson of the god odin he caught the dwarves dvalin and durin and forced them to forge a sword with a golden hilt that would never miss a stroke would never rust and would cut through stone and iron as easily as through clothes the dwarves made the sword and it shone and gleamed like fire however in revenge they cursed it so that it would kill a man every time it was used and that it would be the cause of three great evils they also cursed it so that it would kill svafrlami himself it would cost the life of not only svafrlami but also the life of the swedish hero hjalmar a similar sword to tyrfing is dinsleif a sword by the dwarf din like tyrfing dainsleif gave wounds that never healed and could not be unsheathed without killing a man there is also mistilteinn a sword from the hrmundar saga gripssonar which could never go blunt and which hrmund won from the undead witch king rainn like tyrfing it was taken from a barrow wight the various iterations of the story of the vlsungs include several magic swords the first magical sword which enters the story is gram stuck by odin into the tree barnstokkr in the hall of the vlsungs only sigmund could pull it out this caused considerable envy and conflict eventually sigmund fought odin disguised as an old man and odin shattered the sword sigmund left it for his son sigurd who reforged it to kill fafnir in the nibelungenlied siegfried the middle german equivalent to norse sigurd discarded gram in exchange for another magic sword balmung wagner s version of the story calls the sword nothung rather than balmung which appears both in the anglo saxon poem waldere and in the german scandinavian irekssaga beowulf wielded the sword hrunting that was according to the poem annealed in venom the sword was useless against grendel s mother in desperation beowulf grabbed a giant sword of great age and with it took off the head of the she monster japanese in japanese mythology there is a magical sword called kusanagi which was one of the three crown jewels given to the emperor jimmu by the goddess amaterasu additionally the katana forged by masamune and muramasa were reputedly of such high quality as to be near magical in the case of the masamune and muramasa blades it was believed that some element of the smith s personality was imputed into the blade these three swords have been used extensively in popular culture since then especially in the realm of video game rpgs spanish more pragmatical spanish legends talk too about magical swords two belonged to the warrior rodrigo daz de

is about the administrative divisions of lithuania grand duchy of lithuania 12511569 in the earliest stages of the formation of the lithuanian state there had been several lands lithuanian plural ems singular em such as nalia deltuva and lietuva as well as others they were ruled by regional dukes when king mindaugas 12511263 unified the state he killed expelled or subjugated most of the regional dukes the lands were either added to ruler s domain or granted to members of his family as the grand duchy of lithuania expended into slavic lands the title to the acquired principalities was given to the grand duke s offspring or his other relatives for example mindaugas granted black ruthenia with center in navahrudak to his son vaivilkas gediminas sent his brother fiodor to kiev this system had major disadvantages for the principalities remained semi independent with loose ties to the central government rulers a situation that led to frequent power struggles in early 15th century vytautas the great initiated administrative reforms he replaced regional dukes and princes with trustworthy nobles who depended on the favor of the grand duke this marked the rise of lithuanian nobility in 1413 union of horodo was signed vilnius and trakai voivodeships were created in ethnic lithuanian lands copying the polish system the eldership of samogitia had a special semi autonomous status former slavic principalities and duchies largely preserved their old political social administrative features they were only slowly incorporated into administration of the grand duchy the kiev voivodeship was established in 1471 other five voivodeships were established between 1504 and 1514 the smolensk voivodeship the largest of all was established in 1508 but was lost to the grand duchy of moscow in 1514 voivodeships lithuanian plural vaivadijos singular vaivadija ruled by appointed officials voivodes were further subdivided into powiats lithuanian plural pavietai major administrative reforms took place in 15641566 in preparation for the second statute of lithuania and the overhaul of judicial system the entire territory of the grand duchy with exception of samogitia was divided into 12 voivodeships grand duchy of lithuania 15691795 just before the union of lublin 1569 the four voivodeships of kiev podlaskie bracaw and woy of the grand duchy of lithuania were transferred to the polish crown by direct order of sigismund ii augustus while the duchy of livonia acquired in 1561 became a condominium joint domain of both lithuania and poland this left lithuania with eight voivodeships and one eldership after the livonian war 15581582 lithuania acquired the vassal state of duchy of courland with its capital jelgava this administrative division remained without any major changes until the partitions of the polishlithuanian commonwealth in late 18th century russian empire 17951914 under the russian empire the territory of the former grand duchy of lithuania was divided lithuanian gubernija and districts russian uyezd lithuanian apskritis such system was introducing in russia during the reforms of 1775 the first governorates vilna governorate consisting of eleven districts and slonim governorate were established after the third partition of the polishlithuanian commonwealth just a year later on december 12 1796 they were merged into one governorate called lithuania governorate with capital in vilnius in 1801 lithuania governorate was split into lithuania vilna governorate and lithuania grodno governorate forty years later the word lithuania was dropped from the two names and official maps of europe the territory of the former grand duchy of lithuania became known as the northwestern krai in 1843 another administrative reform took place creating kovno governorate out of seven western districts of the vilna governorate vilna governorate received three additional districts vileyka and dzisna from minsk governorate and lida from grodno governorate in 1837 augustw governorate was established in the territories with russia lithuanian suvalkija was included into this governorate after the january uprising augustw governorate was split into suwaki governorate and oma governorate see administrative division of congress poland this way most of the present day territory of lithuania fell into three governorates vilna kovno and suwaki two more governorates included some small lithuanian territories in 1819 a narrow coastal strip with palanga and ventoji was transferred to the courland governorate this territory was acquired from latvia after an international arbitration in 1920 small areas in northernmost grodno governorate were given to lithuania after it joined the soviet union in 1940 in 1861 after announcing the abolition of serfdom peasants acquired civil rights among them a right to self governmence to facilitate such a right townships russian volost lithuanian valsius and elderates russian mir lithuanian seninija were established by the end of 1861 there were 1 479 elderates 153 townships of kovno governorate the elderates would elect an elder russian starosta lithuanian seninas and representatives to a township council lithuanian valsiaus sueiga however these institutions had very little power and were dependent on the local nobles the power was concentrated in the hands of governors all of whom were appointed by the tsar interwar 19181940 during the interwar lithuania regained independence the first law on administrative sub units was passed on july 1 1919 it declared that lithuania was divided into twenty counties lithuanian singular apskritis plural apskritys several more counties including zarasai naujieji venionys vilnius eiiks lida ashmyany and hrodna were reserved for territories in the vilnius region that lithuania had claims to but were under polish or russian control later on suwaki county was lost to poland but zarasai of the designated counties trakai and sejny had their proclaimed capitals outside the de facto borders of lithuania and had their temporary capitals established at kaiiadorys and lazdijai after the klaipda region was acquired in 1923 it was divided into three counties klaipda ilut and paggiai that way the number of counties increased to twenty three and remained stable until 1939 according to a law passed in 1931 eleven first class cities became independent of county administration and had their own government in march 1939 after an ultimatum from hitler lithuania lost the klaipda region with its three counties in october soviet union returned one fifth of the vilnius region in exchange for red army stations in lithuania acquired vilnius region was divided into three counties vilnius eiiks and naujieji venionys therefore at the end of 1939 lithuania again had twenty three counties counties were further subdivided into townships lithuanian singular valsius plural valsiai further subdivided into elderates lithuanian seninija the counties were governed by a county governor lithuanian apskrities virininkas appointed by the minister of interior being almost the only link between the central government and the local population governors were first responsible for a wide range of duties they were to collect all property left by the retreating german army organize local government recruit local army groups ensure security and stability in the county etc in 1920 they were also entrusted to preside over county police in 1931 in an effort to centralize the government county governors also became the chairmen of a three member county governing body lithuanian apskrities valdyba an executive institution of a county council that way power in a county became centralized in the hands of a governor county councils lithuanian apskrities taryba were elected by local population for a three year term the number of in that township these were the counties their territory and residents according to the 1923 census soviet system 19401994 lithuania was occupied by the soviet union on june 15 1940 however due to ensuring world war ii the authorities did not introduce major changes to the administrative divisions just elderates were renamed to apylink after the second occupation in 1944 the number of counties grew from 26 to 41 eleven counties were added in 194647 and four more were introduced in 1949 at the end of 1947 there were 37 counties subdivided into 320 townships that were further subdivided into approximately 2 900 apylinks the entire interwar system was scraped for the 10th anniversary of the first occupation the new system matched that of other soviet republics on july 20 1950 lithuanian ssr was divided into four provinces russian oblast lithuanian sritis the provinces were further subdivided into 87 districts russian raion kaunas province with 23 districts klaipda province with 16 districts iauliai province with 24 districts and vilnius province with 24 districts the townships were abolished and the districts were further subdivided into apylinks in 1984 there were 527 apylinks in lithuania both provinces and districts were named after their capitals three exceptions were smliai district had its capital in ukmerg also capital of ukmerg district panemun district capital garliava and klaipda district capital gargdai in addition to districts there were five vilnius kaunas klaipda iauliai and panevys province administered cities lithuanian srities pavaldumo miestas they had similar rights as a district the provinces were short lived and on may 28 1953 they were abolished leaving the districts as the first level administrative division the number of districts was reduced several times and in 1962 it settled at 44 the province administered cities were renamed to republic administered cities lithuanian respublikinio pavaldumo miestas to eleven in 1979 these cities became the city municipalities after the reform in 1994 division until dissolution of counties in 2010 19942010 see counties of lithuania municipalities of lithuania elderships the administrative division into 10 counties was created in 1994 modified in 2000 the first level administration was dissolved in 2010 lithuania was divided into 10 counties lithuanian plural apskritys singular apskritis each named after their principal city see counties of lithuania these apskritys should not be confused with apskritys that existed in the interwar period the counties are subdivided into 60 municipalities lithuanian plural savivaldybs singular savivaldyb there are three types of municipalities 43 district municipalities lithuanian rajono savivaldyb they roughly correspond to districts that existed under the soviet rule before 1994 they to as districts the word municipality was added in effort to diminish the soviet heritage districts were created as raions throughout the soviet union 7 city municipalities lithuanian miesto savivaldyb they are situated around major or important cities in common language they are referred to as just cities or as just municipalities because word municipality in lithuanian language is associated more with cities and city rights than with districts 10 municipalities they were all established after 1994 and they do not have the word district associated with them municipalities consist of over 500 elderships lithuanian plural seninijos singular seninija each municipality s government is elected in democratic elections of municipality councils the elections used to take place every three years but now they are held every four years the municipality mayors are elected by municipality councils also municipality councils appoint elders to be in charge of an eldership currently it is proposed that both counties were ruled by apskrities virininkas officially translated as governor who was appointed by the central government in vilnius their primary duty was to ensure that the municipalities obey the laws of lithuania and the constitution they did not have great powers vested in them and so it was suggested that 10 counties are too much for lithuania the smallest county has only four municipalities it was proposed to replace the counties with four or five lands a new administrative unit that would be decided according to the ethnographic regions of lithuania and based on the five major cities on 1 july 2010 the county administrations were abolished and since that date counties remains as the territorial and statistical units comparison of post 1918 systems a package tour or package holiday consists of transport and accommodation advertised and sold together by a vendor known as a tour operator other services may be provided such a rental car activities or outings during the holiday transport can be via charter airline to a foreign country and may also include travel between areas as part of the holiday package holidays are a form of product bundling package holidays are organised by a tour operator and sold to a consumer by a travel agent some travel agents are employees of tour operators others are independent organised tours the first organised tours dated back to thomas cook who on 5 july 1841 chartered a train to take a group of temperance campaigners from leicester to a rally in loughborough eleven miles away by 1872 he was undertaking world wide tours albeit with small groups his company thomas cook amp son commonly called thomas cook or simply cook s grew to become one of the largest and most well the gradual decline of visits to british seaside resorts after the second world war thomas cook amp son began promoting foreign holidays particularly italy spain and switzerland in the early 1950s information films were shown at town halls throughout britain however they made a costly decision by not going into the new form of cheap holidays which combined the transport and accommodation arrangements into a single package the company went further into decline and were only rescued by a consortium buy out on 26 may 1972 package tours vladimir raitz the co founder of the horizon holiday group pioneered the first mass package holidays abroad with charter flights between gatwick airport and corsica in 1950 and organised the first package holiday to palma in 1952 lourdes in 1953 and the costa brava and sardinia in 1954 in addition the amendments made in montreal to the convention on international civil aviation on june 14 1954 was very liberal to spain allowing impetus for mass tourism using charter planes by the late 1950s flight transfers and accommodation provided the first chance for most people in the united kingdom to have affordable travel abroad one of the first charter airlines was euravia which commenced flights from manchester airport in 1961 and luton airport in 1962 despite opening up mass tourism to crete and the algarve in 1970 the package tour industry declined during the 1970s on 15 august 1974 the industry was shaken when the second largest tour operator court line which operated under the brand names of horizon and clarksons collapsed nearly 50 000 tourists were stranded overseas and a further 100 000 faced the loss of booking deposits in 2005 a growing number of consumers were avoiding package holidays and were instead travelling with budget airlines and booking their own accommodation in the uk the downturn in the package holiday market led to the consolidation of the tour operator market which is now dominated by a few large tour operators the major operators are thomson holidays and first choice part of tui ag and thomas cook ag under holiday operators catering to different markets such as club 18 30 or simply travel budget airlines have also created their own package holiday divisions such as jet2 holidays the trend for package holiday bookings saw a comeback in 2009 as customers sought greater financial security in the wake of a number of holiday and flight companies going bust and as the hidden costs of no frills flights increased coupled with the search for late holidays as holidaymakers left booking to the last moment this led to a rise in consumers booking package holidays dynamic packaging dynamic packaging is a method that is becoming increasingly used in package holiday booking procedures that enables consumers to build their own package of flights

ndash 24 september 1873 was an english psychiatrist archaeologist and ethnologist he was medical superintendent of the retreat the quaker psychiatric hospital near york in 1848 he reported two maternal first cousins with an unusual condition affecting the skin hair and teeth an ectodermal dysplasia he had performed an examination post mortem on one of the two men including relevant histopathology life thurnam was born at lingcroft near copmanthorpe york to the quaker william thurnam and his wife sarah clark after a private education he became a member of the royal college of surgeons in 1834 a licentiate of the royal college of physicians in 1843 and a fellow in 1859 he graduated m d at the university of aberdeen in 1846 having served as resident medical officer in the westminster hospital from 1834 till 1838 thurnam was appointed medical superintendent of the friends retreat in york that post he held until 1849 the wiltshire county asylum at thurnam to be medical superintendent it was opened in 1851 and he remained in active charge until his death thurnam s leisure was devoted to statistical facts on mental illness and investigations of anthropological and antiquarian interest he was twice elected president of the medico psychological association thurnam died at devizes on 18 june 1851 he had married frances elizabeth daughter of matthew wyatt a metropolitan police magistrate and sister of sir matthew digby wyatt by her he left three sons works while at the westminster hospital he had gained some reputation from his observations on aneurysm of the heart in 1843 he published observations and essays on the statistics of insanity and on establishments for the insane this work contained a reprint of the statistics of the york retreat first issued in 1841 together with a historical and descriptive sketch after his move to wiltshire he gave special consideration to craniology thurnam with dr joseph barnard davis published a work in two volumes under the title of crania britannica and davis were both believers in polygenism in the form that different races had been created separately davis was a collector of craniums and had over 1700 specimens because of the racial differences of the craniums davis and thurnam believed that proofs of polygenism were to be found in studying the skull types of different races from different sizes and types of skull they deduced separate origins two shorter papers were synostoses of the cranial bones regarded as a race character nat hist rev 1865 and weight of the human brain journ of ment science 1868 thurnam recognised the importance of the obliteration of the sutures of the skull which he had observed in the dolichocephalous crania of the stone age but not in the brachycephalous crania of the bronze period his conclusion was that this is a strictly race character the free fall time is the characteristic time that would take a body to collapse under its own gravitational attraction if no other forces existed to oppose the collapse as such it plays a fundamental role in setting the timescale for a wide variety of astrophysical processesfrom star formation to helioseismology to supernovaein which gravity plays a dominant role derivation infall to a point source of gravity it is relatively simple to derive the free fall time by applying nothing more than kepler s third law of planetary motion to a degenerate elliptic orbit consider a point mass math m math a distance math r math from a point source of mass math m math which falls radially inward to it crucially kepler s third law depends only on the semi major axis of the orbit and does not depend on the eccentricity a purely radial trajectory is an example of a degenerate ellipse with an eccentricity of 1 and semi major axis math r 2 math therefore the time it would take a body to fall inward is the same as the period of a circular orbit of radius math r 2 math or math torbit frac2 pisqrt g m m 27 107995 toolong r3 2sqrt2 g m m math to see that the semi major axis is math r 2 math we must examine properties of orbits as they become increasingly elliptical kepler s first law states that an orbit is an ellipse with the center of mass as one focus in the case of a very small mass falling toward a very large mass math m math the center of mass is within the larger mass the focus of an ellipse is increasingly off center with increasing ellipticity in the limiting case of a degenerate ellipse with an eccentricity of 1 the orbit extends from the initial position of the infalling object math r math to the point source of mass math m math in other words the ellipse becomes a line of length math r math the semi major axis is half the width of the ellipse along the long axis which in the degenerate case becomes math r 2 math it would begin at distance math r math from the point source mass math m math fall inward until it reached that point source then turn around and journey back to its original position in real systems the point source mass is n t truly a point source and the infalling body eventually collides with some surface thus it only completes half the orbit but since the infalling part of the orbit is symmetric to the hypothetical outgoing portion of the orbit we can simply divide the period of the full orbit by two to attain the free fall time the time along the infalling portion of the orbit math tff torbit 2 fracpi2 fracr3 2 sqrt2 g m m math this formula also follows from the formula for the falling time as a function of position note that math torbit math in the above equation is the time for the mass to fall in a highly eccentric orbit make a hairpin turn at the central mass at nearly zero radius distance and then returns to r when it repeats the motion back and from distance r to distance 0 as noted above this orbit has only half as long a semimajor axis r 2 as a circular orbit with radius r where the semimajor axis is r and thus the period for the shorter high eccentricity orbit is that for one with an axis of r 2 and a total orbital pathlength of only twice the infall distance thus by kepler s third law with half the semimajor axis radius it thus takes only 1 2 sup 3 2 sup 1 8 sup 1 2 sup as long a time period as the corresponding circular orbit that has a constant radius the same as the maximal radius of the eccentric orbit which goes to essentially zero radius from the primary at its other extreme the time to traverse half the distance r which is the infall time from r along an eccentric orbit is the kepler time for a circular orbit of r 2 not r which is 1 32 sup 1 2 sup times for example the time for an object in the orbit of the earth around the sun to fall into the sun if it were suddenly stopped in orbit would be math p sqrt32 math where p is one year this is about 64 6 days infall of a spherically symmetric distribution of mass now consider a case where the mass math m math is not a point mass but is distributed in a spherically symmetric distribution about the center with an average mass density of math rho math math rho frac3 m4 pi r3 math where the volume of a sphere is math 4 3 pi r3 math let us assume that the only force acting is gravity then as first demonstrated by newton and can easily be demonstrated using the divergence theorem the acceleration of gravity at any given distance math r math from the center of the sphere depends only upon the total mass contained within math r math the consequence of this result is that if one imagined breaking each shell would collapse only subsequent to the shells interior to it and no shells cross during collapse as a result the free fall time of a massless particle at math r math can be expressed solely in terms of the total mass math m math interior to it in terms of the average density interior to math r math math tff frac14sqrt frac3 pi2 g rhosimeq 0 5427 frac1 sqrt g rhosimeq 66430 rm s frac1 sqrt rho math where the latter is in si units this result is exactly the same as from the previous section when math m gg m math applications the free fall time is a very useful estimate of the relevant timescale for a number of astrophysical processes to get a sense of its application we may write math tff simeq frac35 mboxminsqrtrho cdot sqrtfracmboxgmboxcm3 math here we have estimated the numerical value for the free fall time as roughly 35 minutes for a body of mean density 1 g cm sup 3 sup comparison for an object falling takes from a given position to fall to the central point mass is the same as the free fall time except for a constant math frac43pi math 0 42 dewey square is a square in downtown boston massachusetts usa it lies at the intersection of atlantic avenue summer street federal street purchase street and surface artery with the central artery i 93 passing underneath in the dewey square tunnel and big dig south station is on the southeast corner of the square with amtrak and mbta commuter rail services as well as red line subway trains and silver line bus rapid transit underneath it is named for the only admiral of the navy in u s history george dewey history the square was named in honor of admiral george dewey after his decisive 1898 victory in the battle of manila bay before the central artery demolition of the 1950s it was simply an intersection with traffic islands and rail infrastructure surrounded by buildings with no open space in 1898 summer street was extended east as a local road and in 1899 the summer street bridge was built across fort point channel also in 1899 way for the new south station and atlantic avenue was extended along the west side of the new terminal along with a realignment of the union freight railroad the atlantic avenue elevated came in 1901 with an elevated station also called south station one block south of dewey square it was closed in 1938 and torn down in the early 1940s the union freight railroad lasted until 1970 the legendary alto saxophonist charlie parker titled a composition dewey square for an october 28 1947 session that also featured trumpeter miles davis the next major change came in the 1950s when the central artery was built the whole area on the north and south sides of the square was cleared and the artery was built underground via the dewey square tunnel atlantic avenue became one way northbound and purchase street one way southbound to the north of the square and the new surface artery came in as a two way road above the tunnel heading southwest from the square between 1969 and 1978 boston closed both federal street they had formerly operated as a one way pair summer street has since reopened as a two way road but federal street is still a pedestrian mall the big dig in the late 1990s and early 2000s kept the one way configurations north of the square but now atlantic avenue continues as one way northbound south of the square and surface artery is one way southbound for some time a temporary intercity bus depot for providers such as peter pan trailways and others was located just north of dewey square over the central artery this temporary bus station replaced an earlier trailways bus station that had been located in park square all intercity buses were relocated in 1993 to the nearby south station bus terminal just south of south station situated above the train tracks by the 21st century use of the term dewey square to describe the locale had all but disappeared from common vernacular although directional signs inside south station still use the term

the italian risorgimento which took place in 1860 a corps of volunteers led by giuseppe garibaldi landed in sicily in order to conquer the kingdom of the two sicilies ruled by the bourbons the project was an ambitious and risky venture aiming to conquer with a thousand men a kingdom with a larger regular army and a more powerful navy the expedition was a success and concluded with a plebiscite that brought naples and sicily into the kingdom of sardinia the last territorial conquest before the creation of the kingdom of italy on 17 march 1861 the sea venture was the only desired action that was jointly decided by the four fathers of the nation italian giuseppe mazzini giuseppe garibaldi victor emmanuel ii and camillo cavour pursuing divergent goals it is difficult to determine the true instigator mazzini desired to release the mezzogiorno and rome while garibaldi wanted to conquer in the name of and continue to rome to complete the unity of italy and cavour wanted to avoid at all costs conflict with his french ally napoleon iii who protected rome the expedition also brings new large collective ambiguity and misunderstanding for garibaldi it is to achieve a united italy to the sicilian bourgeoisie an independent sicily as part of the kingdom of italy and for the mass farmers the end of oppression and land distribution background the events of the expedition took place within the overall process of the unification of italy which was largely orchestrated by camillo cavour prime minister of sardinia piedmont as his life s work after the annexation of the grand duchy of tuscany the duchies of modena and parma and the romagna to piedmont in march 1860 italian nationalists set their sights on the kingdom of the two sicilies which comprised all of southern mainland italy and sicily as the next step toward their dream of unification of all italian lands in 1860 garibaldi already the an expedition against sicily and naples with the covert support of the united kingdom sicilian leaders among them francesco crispi were discontented with neapolitan rule over the island moreover britain was worried by the approaches of the neapolitans towards the russian empire in the latter s attempt to open its way to the mediterranean sea the strategic importance of the sicilian ports was also to be dramatically increased by the opening of the suez canal it has been also suggested by lorenzo del boca among the others that british support for garibaldi s expedition was spurred by the necessity to obtain more favourable economic conditions for sicilian sulfur which was needed in great quantities for the new steamers the search for a casus belli the kingdom of sardinia piedmont needed a presentable casus belli in order to attack the kingdom of the two sicilies this was needed for the house of savoy which however never gave any declaration of war against the bourbon kingdom a necessary condition since this was among the requirements presented this requirement was an uprising from within such an event would have felt the alienation of the people to the dynasty that ruled in naples and particularly the inability of francis of bourbon to ensure in forms acceptable public policy in their domains sicily as shown by the history of the past decades was fertile ground and the liberal south especially those returning after an amnesty granted by the young king who worked in this direction for some time the expedition the red shirts in march 1860 exile rosolino pilo exhorted giuseppe garibaldi to take charge of an expedition to liberate southern italy from bourbon rule at first garibaldi was against it but eventually agreed by may 1860 garibaldi had collected 1 089 volunteers for his expedition to sicily the majority of the volunteers came from lombardy 434 volunteers other significant numbers of volunteers came from occupied venetia 194 volunteers genoa 156 volunteers and tuscany 78 volunteers neapolitan volunteers but only 11 from rome and the papal states thirty three 33 foreigners joined the expedition amongst them istvn trr and three other hungarians and fourteen 14 italians from the trentino of the austrian empire the majority of the volunteers were students and artisans from the lower classes the 1 089 volunteers were poorly armed with dated muskets and were dressed in a minimalist uniform consisting of a red shirt and grey trousars during the night of 5 may a small group led by nino bixio seized two steamships in genoa from the rubattino shipping company in order to transport the volunteers to sicily they took the two ships which they had renamed il piemonte and il lombardo to the nearby rocks at quarto where the volunteers including franceso crispi s wife rosalie embarked for sicily landing in sicily the ships landed at marsala on the westernmost point of sicily on 11 may to deter the bourbon ships the lombardo was attacked and sunk only after the disembarkation had been completed while the piemonte was captured the landing had been preceded by the arrival of francesco crispi and others who had the task of gaining the support of the locals for the volunteers on 14 may at salemi garibaldi announced that he was assuming dictatorship over sicily in the name of king victor emmanuel ii of sardinia calatafimi and palermo the mille won a first battle at calatafimi against around 2 000 neapolitan troops on 15 may the battle boosted the morale of the mille and at the same time depressed the neapolitans who were poorly led by their often corrupted higher officers and started to feel themselves abandoned in the meantime the ranks of the mille enlarged to 1 200 with local men joining on 27 may with the help of a popular insurrection the s capital the city was defended by some 16 000 men but these were under the confused and timid direction of general ferdinando lanza aged 75 probably one of the neapolitan officers bribed with english money see evaluation section while two columns of garibaldines attacked the perimeter part of the population strengthened by 2 000 prisoners liberated from the local jails rose against the garrison when his troops were driven back from most of their positions lanza ordered them to bombard the city for three days causing the deaths of 600 civilians by 28 may garibaldi controlled much of the city and declared the bourbon authority deposed the following day a desperate neapolitan counteroffensive was driven back and lanza asked for a truce however when a reinforcement party of well equipped and well trained troops arrived in the city the situation became very serious for garibaldi who was saved only by lanza s decision to surrender through the mediation of a british admiral an armistice was signed and the neapolitan fleet calatafimi

insurrection that had broken out in catania on 31 may led by nicola fabrizi was crushed by the local garrison but the order to leave for messina meant that this neapolitan tactical success would have no practical results at the time only syracuse augusta milazzo and messina remained in royal hands in sicily in the meantime garibaldi issued his first law a levy failed to muster more than 20 000 troops while the peasants who hoped to an immediate relief from the grievous conditions to which they were forced by the landowners revolted in several localities at bronte on 4 august 1860 garibaldi s friend nino bixio bloodily repressed one of these revolts with two had worried cavour who in early july sent him a proposal of immediate annexation of sicily to piedmont garibaldi however refused vehemently to allow such a move until the end of the war cavour s envoy la farina was arrested and expelled from the island he was replaced by the more malleable agostino depretis who gained garibaldi s trust and was appointed as pro dictator on 25 june 1860 king francis ii of the two sicilies had issued a constitution however this late attempt to conciliate his moderate subjects failed to rouse them to defend the regime while liberals and revolutionaries were eager to welcome garibaldi at the time garibaldi had created the esercito meridionale southern army reinforced by other volunteers from italy and some regular piedmontese soldiers disguised as deserters the neapolitans had mustered some 24 000 men for the defence of messina and the other fortresses on 20 july garibaldi attacked milazzo with 5 000 men the neapolitan defence was gallant but again the absence of the army in the island to send reinforcements from messina granted the mille another victory six days later clary surrendered the city of messina to garibaldi leaving only 4 000 in the citadel and other forts the other strongholds surrendered by the end of september landing and conquest in calabria on 19 august garibaldi s men disembarked in calabria a move opposed by cavour who had written the dictator a letter urging him to not cross the strait garibaldi however disobeyed an act which had the silent approval of king victor emmanuel the bourbons had some 20 000 men in calabria but apart from some episodes like that of reggio calabria which was conquered at high cost by bixio on 21 august they offered insignificant resistance as numerous units of the bourbon army disbanded spontaneously or even joined garibaldi s ranks on 30 august a conspicuous sicilian army led by general ghio was officially disbanded at soveria mannelli while only minor and dispersed units continued the fight the end king francis ii was thus forced to abandon naples and entrench himself in the formidable fortress of gaeta while a last stand was set up on the volturno river north of naples on 7 september garibaldi took possession of naples with little harm he entered the city by train hailed as a liberator by the population in the meantime the kingdom of sardinia invaded the papal states conquering central italy lazio excluded through few battles such as the battle of castelfidardo and entered the kingdom of two sicilies joining giuseppe garibaldi in the decisive battle of the volturnus 1 and 2 october garibaldi with a force of 24 000 men was not able to conclusively defeat the neapolitan army about 25 000 men only the arrival of the sardinian army obliged the last organized bourbon force to entrench in gaeta a few days later 21 october a plebiscite confirmed the annexation of the kingdom of the two sicilies to the kingdom of sardinia by an overwhelming majority the meeting in teano northern campania between victor emmanuel and garibaldi 26 october 1860 others assign instead the end of the campaign to the king s entrance into naples on 7 november however the military campaign was not yet fully completed as francis ii held out in gaeta until february of the next year when he finally surrendered to the armies led by giuseppe garibaldi and enrico cialdini and left for exile in the papal states shortly thereafter in march 1861 the new kingdom of italy regno d italia was formally established garibaldi asked the king to remain in the former two sicilies for a year as dictator he also asked that his officers be integrated in the new italian army when victor emmanuel

the thousand has traditionally been one of the most celebrated events of the italian risorgimento the process of the unification of italy in the following years the rise of local resistance the so called brigantaggio or brigandage required at one point the presence of some 140 000 piedmontese troops to maintain control of the former kingdom of the two sicilies traditionally the handling of the brigantaggio has received a negative judgement by italian historians in strict contrast with the heroism attributed to garibaldi and his followers the english historian denis mack smith for example points out the deficiencies and reticence of the sources available for the period the expedition moreover obtained the support of the powerful great landowners of southern italy in exchange for the promise that their properties be left intact in the upcoming political settlement numerous sicilian peasants however had joined the mille hoping working it the consequences of this misunderstanding

character portrayed by actor bob denver begins the series as a stereotypical beatnik with a goatee hip slang language and a generally unkempt bohemian appearance his abhorrence of conventional social forms is signified by comical reactions to three words work marriage and police for example whenever the word work is mentioned even in passing he yelps work and jumps with fear or even faints he

devoured cleveland maynard may be described as the prototype of the late 1960s hippie many of the later episodes center around maynard with dobie more of an observer but always as narrator the series

national plan on elimination of child labour in south africa it was provisionally adopted by a large group of key stakeholders in september 2003 these stakeholders include key government departments including those responsible for labour education provincial and local government water service justice policing prosecution social development and education the lead department is the department of labour it was previously known as the child labour action programme but was renamed in february 2006 because of the negative connotation attached to the abbreviation clap the first phase was from 2004 to march 2008 and referred to as the clpa 1 many departments and other stakeholders have been implementing aspects of the child labour programme of action since 2004 however the minister of labour plans to submit it for formal cabinet approval only once a costing study has been done this study aims at calculating the additional cost to government of key elements of this programme in september 2007 of implementation april 2008 to march 2013 this is referred to as clpa 2 the programme towards the elimination of the worst forms of child labour tecl was regarding its activities in south africa during its first phase 20042008 essentially an executing agency for key elements of the child labour programme of action background the south african constitution provides that children under 18 have a right to be protected from work that is exploitative hazardous inappropriate for their age detrimental to their schooling or detrimental to their social physical mental spiritual or moral development the term work is not limited to work in economic activities e g paid employment but includes chores or household activities in the child s household such as collecting wood and fuel where such work is exploitative hazardous inappropriate for their age or detrimental to their development the term child labour as used in the child labour programme of action covers estimates that there were about one million of south africa s children who are working as child labourers south africa has ratified the ilo minimum age convention 1973 c138 this convention requires ratifying states to pursue a national policy designed to ensure the effective abolition of child labour and to progressively raise the minimum age for admission to employment or work south africa also assisted in drafting the worst forms of child labour convention 1999 c182 which it ratified in 2000 in terms of this convention south africa must take time bound measures to eliminate the worst forms of child labour wfcl these include forms of bonded labour commercial sexual exploitation of children trafficking of children and the use of children by others in illegal activities including drug trafficking since 1996 the government of south africa has been involved in a process towards the formulation of appropriate policies and a national action programme to combat child labour the department of labour is the lead department in the process the south african directly and indirectly improving the situation of children many are aimed at addressing poverty for example the public works programmes the provision of basic infrastructure access to basic services and the roll out of social grants that benefit children the programmes are funded for the most part from the government budget the child labour programme of action is intended to complement and strengthen the existing programmes where they are not adequately preventing child labour the first step in the development of the south african programme was the establishment of a reliable and credible database on child work in the country in 1999 statistics south africa conducted the first national household based survey of child work in south africa the survey of activities of young people sayp in addition to the sayp as part of the development of the child labour programme of action all known qualitative research conducted within south africa on areas relevant to this policy was reviewed this review was used in particular to inform those elements of the policy that can not address and was published as discussion document towards a national child labour action programme the sayp and review of qualitative research confirmed that south africa does not seem to have as serious a problem in regard to child labour as some other countries in particular the extent of child labour in the formal sectors of the economy is limited however the sayp also confirmed that there indeed are children in the country who are doing unacceptable amounts of work or work of an unacceptable nature south africa clearly needs to address these if it is to fulfill its commitment in terms of the constitution and international conventions addressing the problems sooner rather than later should also help to avoid their multiplying and becoming more serious and difficult to address in the future national consultations that led towards the child labour programme of action following the process of gathering information the government of south africa began formulating appropriate policies and a national action programme to combat child labour this was done through a engagement with key stakeholders stakeholders consulted included government departments organised labour organised business and relevant non governmental organisations ngos the consultation process included focus groups with affected children who were asked about their experiences and subsequently asked for their opinion on proposed policy measures aimed at addressing their specific circumstances exercises were also conducted with children in grade seven in schools throughout the country the consultative process has culminated in the drafting of a national clap for south africa the process of developing the child labour programme of action was overseen and guided by an inter sectoral national steering committee involving key departments employers and workers organisations ngos and the community constituency of south africa s nedlac national economic development amp labour council the national steering committee was coordinated and chaired by the department of labour guiding principles the following principles were applied in the drafting of the child labour programme of action need for prioritisation because of limited resources the programme identified the forms of child work that should be prioritised number of children involved and the degree of harm of particular forms of work the country also needed to take action first and urgently on the worst forms of child labour identified in the convention learn from others where appropriate south africa has developed an indigenous programme that suits the local context but has borrowed where appropriate best practices from other countries it has also learnt from the mistakes of others the programme of action must be as realistic as possible and take into account existing financial and human capacity and the extent to which capacity can be further developed within the time and resources available the programme must be sustainable to achieve sustainability it must be able to be funded from government funds after a possible initial injection of donor funds which the international labour organisation ilo has undertaken to help government access to assist with once off expenditures that can kick start ongoing sustainable activities the programme must build on and fit in with existing programmes of government the child labour programme the mandates of a wide range of government departments and agencies for each activity the programme identifies the lead department as well as other departments and agencies including non governmental agencies which would be involved the views of the government agencies involved were canvassed during the formulation of the programme and modifications introduced where necessary treasury s budget officers were also consulted to ensure that the proposals would mesh with budgetary plans the majority of the activities making up the child labour programme of action already forms part of government policy in these cases the programme confirms that these activities contribute to addressing child labour where appropriate it proposes that implementation be strengthened in some cases the programme suggests a variation of an existing programme or policy which will allow it to combat child labour more effectively neither of the above two types of proposals will involve significant expenditure or other resources from government in a few cases the child labour programme of action proposes new activities some of which will necessitate new expenditures each activity whether existing a variation of existing or new the programme identifies whether once off and ongoing costs will be minimal moderate or significant the department of labour will undertake a costing exercise regarding at least those items identified as being moderately or significantly costly key elements of the child labour programme of action targeting the rollout of government and other stakeholders programmes and policies on poverty employment labour and social matters more effectively in areas where the work that children do has serious negative affects on them promoting new legislative measure against worst forms of child labour strengthening of national capacity to enforce legislative measures increasing public awareness and social mobilisation against the worst forms of child labour large scale projects with significant financial demands and substantial human resource requirements have been avoided since they will not be realistic or sustainable in a few cases however action steps have been included which may have significant cost implications the most important of these is the proposed extension of the qualifying age for the by 2006 the child turns 15 so as to avoid the current contradiction with the basic conditions of employment act prohibiting child work below that age as well as the provisions on compulsory schooling the programme also proposes a further roll out of the child support grant up to the age of 17 by 2008 this will encourage children to remain in school and so help to avoid children s engagement in hazardous works activities and other wfcl kottayil

philip k dick sold approximately fifteen short stories himself before becoming a client of the scott meredith literary agency roog was his first sale but not his first published story story roog tells the story from the point of view of a dog named boris who observes his master s carefully stored food in containers outside of their house day after day unbeknownst to the dog these are the human s trash cans for garbage the dog is later horrified to witness some food being stolen by garbage men who the dog knows are predatory carnivores from another planet the dog comes to know these beings as roogs and tries to warn his master of each theft with cries of roog roog the humans unable to comprehend the hound s message think the dog is just being rowdy thus they attribute the sound the dog makes to be the sound that all dogs make when they are excited roog being somewhat distraught barking roog very loudly at the garbagemen before they make off once more with trash in their garbage truck publication roog was written in november 1951 and appeared in the magazine of fantasy amp science fiction november 1953 without illustration during this time dick worked in a record store in an essay prefacing a collection of his short stories published in 1978 dick recalled the story s gestation as well as discussing its plot its general themes and his reaction at the time dick relates that he contacted anthony boucher a sci fi fantasy publisher editor and fellow writer whom dick recalls as a kind friend dick wrote without boucher s help i d still be in the record business i mean that very seriously as a young man dick was very pleased with the publication and wondered if he could quit his job at a record store and work full time as an author while the older dick 27 years on s original publication boucher attempted to get it published once more in a sci fi anthology being compiled by a person dick refers to as ms j m judith merrill however she disliked the story finding it obscure and hard to understand she also criticized dick s description of the garbagemen as inaccurate apparently unable to see that the description is from the protagonist dog s perspective despite dick explaining the story in a letter to j m regarding the themes of the work she rejected the story anthony boucher however proceeded to publish it and it remains in print today at one time even appearing in a high school literature textbook trivia the dog in roog boris was based upon a real dog called snooper who belonged to a neighbor of dick snooper became very alarmed every time the garbagemen arrived to pick up trash and this inspired dick to write the short story dick regarded roog as quite a serious story despite its the collected stories of philip k dick that roog tells of fear it tells of loyalty and of obscure menace references flashfire is a fictional character in the marvel universe flashfire also known as tempest is a long time member of the shi ar imperial guard

overall victories for the tories in ireland their win however did not mean that ireland was supporting the tories though the party did have some strong pockets of support on the island the win was a result of a restricted electoral franchise which saw voting restricted to the middle and upper classes who were disproportionately supportive of the tory party in ireland electoral reform in subsequent decades saw a sharp decline in tory fortunes in ireland with new voters who had not been tory supporters anyhow supporting first of all the liberal party notably in the 1868 general election in ireland and later the irish parliamentary party from the 1874 general election in ireland onwards results vice vukov 3 august 1936 24 september 2008 was a croatian singer and politician

by muse software in 1984 the game is famous for featuring sampled speech uncommon in the early 1980s the speech samples include hey taxi pad one please and similar samples for different pads thanks and up please these are said in a variety of voice pitches creating the feeling of different taxi customers gameplay space taxi is an action game there are 24 different levels all in sequential order and the player has to complete all of them space taxi simulates a flying taxi the taxi is controlled by four thrusters and has landing gear that can be switched on or off switching landing gear on disables the side thrusters but landing without landing gear destroys the taxi landing with high velocity or not landing properly i e having only one of the gear stands on the platform while having the other in midair in each level there is a set of numbered platforms at regular intervals a customer materializes out of nowhere on a randomly selected platform the player has to fly their taxi to that platform whereupon the customer will enter the taxi saying which platform he wants to go to when the player takes him to that platform he will pay the taxi fee and tip based upon how fast the trip takes and the smoothness of the landing after each numbered platform has been successfully visited the next customer will say up please whereupon the gate at the top of the level will open flying through the gate completes the level one must also be careful not to land on or hit the customer with the taxi not only because he will angrily yell hey and then disappear before appearing somewhere else on the platform is increasingly difficult on smaller platforms where the platform will barely fit the customer and the taxi each level features a different setting or theme such as a treat strewn candyland or a snowy winter landscape and most have some special feature to hinder the player s job some of the features include a table tennis ball bouncing across the level snowflakes falling from the sky a series of radar masts interfering with the controls or teleports that send the player to a random location the taxi also has a limited fuel supply the fuel level resets at the end of each level but on some of the more complicated screens it is necessary to refuel this is accomplished by flying to a special platform marked with an f and containing a gas pump the player must pay for fuel out of the money he has earned passengers do not make allowances for pitstops and their tip will continue to decrease as the player tanks up the taxi s fuel consumption is based upon the time are used so if a player needs to get from one side of the screen to the other it consumes less fuel though is more dangerous to accelerate halfway across the screen and then reverse thrust than to use one small thrust to move slowly across the screen and occasional upward thrusts to maintain altitude after completing all levels the player gets to a special mystery level in which the player is greeted with the message welcome to museworld and three platforms each with a figure relating to another muse software game an ambulance representing rescue squad 1983 also john f kutcher the soldier with
